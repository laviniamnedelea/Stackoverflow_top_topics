20728,What's the best way to create ClickOnce deployments,<p>Our team develops distributed winform apps. We use ClickOnce for deployment and are very pleased with it.</p> <p>However we've found the pain point with ClickOnce is in <em>creating</em> the deployments. We have the standard dev/test/production environments and need to be able to create deployments for each of these that install and update separate from one another. Also we want control over what assemblies get deployed. Just because an assembly was compiled doesn't mean we want it deployed.</p> <p>The obvious first choice for creating deployments is Visual Studio. However VS really doesn't address the issues stated. The next in line is the SDK tool Mage. Mage works OK but creating deployments is rather tedious and we don't want every developer having our code signing certificate and password.</p> <p>What we ended up doing was rolling our own deployment app that uses the command line version of Mage to create the ClickOnce manifest files.</p> <p>I'm satisfied with our current solution but is seems like there would be an industry-wide accepted approach to this problem. Is there?</p>,20806,2,0,,2008-08-21 18:35:04.410 UTC,5,2015-11-30 02:03:49.403 UTC,2015-11-30 02:03:49.403 UTC,,1321,whatknott,1321,,1,13,winforms|deployment|clickonce,2534

29253893,mixture of left-handed and right-handed philosophers a tricky questions?,<blockquote> <p>Lemma 1: we know at any table with a mixture of left-handed and right-handed philosophers deadlock cannot occur. I very familiar with it proofs.</p> </blockquote> <p>I ran into a following question on Interview recently. </p> <p>There are 5 philosophers sitting at a round table. between each two philosophers there is a chopsticks. each philosophers need two chopsticks to eat. we have two type of philosophers: left-handed and right-handed. left-handed first take a chopsticks with left hands. right-handed first take a chopsticks with right hands. suppose among 5 philosophers there is at least 1 left-handed and at least 1 right-handed. which of them is True:</p> <blockquote> <p>a) independent from the combination of placement philosophers at round table there is no deadlock. (I sure True)</p> <p>b) if all of the philosophers simultaneously take the first chopsticks there is a deadlock. (I thin this is true because in implication if we have a-->b and a is false a-->b is true. and in this option there is no way to all philosopher simultaneously take the first chopsticks so the whole statement is true.)</p> </blockquote> <p>Any expert could help me that I argument is True? </p> <blockquote> <p>Edit 1: I add the proof for Lemma1: (but the question mentioned above has some differences. ) </p> <p>First observe that due to the pattern of resource acquisition around the table there is only one possible wait-cycle i.e. the cycle involving all philosophers. So assume such a deadlock. Every philosopher must be waiting by which we mean waiting for a chopstock held by another. Thus all chopsticks must be held. If our table has a mixture of left-handed and right-handed philosophers there must be at least one pair of adjacent philosophers of opposite handedness. First assume a left-handed philosopher (“Lenny”) seated to the left of a right-handed philosopher (“Roger”). Because all chopsticks must be held either Lenny or Roger must hold the chopstick which is between them. If Lenny holds it that is his “right chopstick” so he must previously have acquired the chopstick to his left. Thus Lenny holds two chopsticks and is not waiting to acquire any (he is eating) so there is not a deadlock. If Roger holds the chopstick which is between them that is his “left chopstick” so he must previously have acquired the chopstock to his right etc. If we call the previous case the “outward reaching” case then the “inward reaching” case is a right-handed philosopher seated to the left of a left-handed philosopher. Again if we have a deadlock all chopsticks must be held so one of them holds the chopstick between them. This means that the other one holds no chopsticks since the one between them is the ﬁrst one each will try to acquire (either Roger reached right and got it or Lenny reached left and got it; the other is waiting for it before reaching in the outward direction). If there are n philosphers and n chopsticks all chopsticks held but one philosopher holds zero chopsticks then n−1 philosophers hold n chopsticks. Some philospher must hold two chopsticks; that philosopher is not waiting (he is eating) so there is no deadlock.</p> </blockquote>,29255521,1,0,,2015-03-25 11:04:42.587 UTC,,2015-03-26 21:06:25.343 UTC,2015-03-25 12:45:26.280 UTC,user4249446,,user4249446,,,1,1,operating-system|deadlock|semaphore|critical-section|dining-philosopher,318

14115344,Function not getting called,<p>I'm implementing a http server in C. I have a custom function for writing headers. When I call it it doesn't do anything. I have placed an arbitrary printf inside the function to make sure that it's called and it doesn't produce output too. Program compiles with success and works normally as intended aside from this issue. I can connect to server which results in empty response due to this problem. I can easily use <code>fprintf</code> instead but I want to understand the problem. The function is declared as follows:</p> <pre class= lang-c prettyprint-override ><code>void write_response_ln(FILE *fp char *format ...) { va_list args; printf( dsgsfdg ); strcat(format \r\n ); va_start(args format); vfprintf(fp format args); va_end(args); } </code></pre> <p>It is located in it's own file apart from the file in which the caller is. Even though it is called 4 times client processes report empty response. Why does this happen? BTW I'm using gcc 4.7 on linux to compile this.</p> <p><hr/> Here is the caller function:</p> <pre class= lang-c prettyprint-override ><code>static pid_t handle_connection(size_t bfrsz int fd_connect pid_t kid_pid) { int c; char *headers = malloc(bfrsz); FILE *res = fdopen(fd_connect a+ ); kid_pid = getpid(); bzero(headers bfrsz); fgets(headers bfrsz res); fprintf(stdout REQ: %s\n  headers); write_response_ln(res HTTP 200 OK ); write_response_ln(res Content-Type:text/html ); write_response_ln(res ); write_response_ln(res I don't have a parser yet. ); fclose(res); // Commit suicide. printf( Transaction: Complete: Kill: [%d]\n  kid_pid); sleep(1); kill(kid_pid SIGINT); free(headers); return kid_pid; } </code></pre> <p>And a go with the gdb gave me this:</p> <pre><code>(gdb) break write_response_ln Breakpoint 1 at 0x400f80: file headers.c line 8.

In the following explanation we assume that the type potrace_word holds N bits.</p> <p>A bitmap of dimensions w*h is divided bottom to top into h horizontal scanlines. Each scanline is divided left to right into blocks of N pixels. Each such block of N pixels is stored as a single potrace_word with the leftmost pixels of the block corresponding to the most significant bit of the word and the rightmost pixel of the block corresponding to the least significant bit of the word. Pixels that are “on” (or “black” or “foreground”) are represented by bit value 1. Pixels that are “off” (of “white” or “background”) are represented by bit value 0. If the number of bits in a scanline is not divisible by N then the rightmost word of the scanline is padded on the right with zeros. The data for scanline 0 (the bottom-most scanline) begins at map[0]. The data for scanline 1 begins at map[dy]. The data for scanline 2 begins at map[2*dy] and so forth.

30789018,Passing Variables to a Separate PHP page (Graphics Draw),<p>I have a graphics draw image in which I would like to pass in a variable to represent the height of my image (a rectangle).

I want to pass the variable/value to another page which draws my graphic in PHP. As of now the image is showing up fine when I set the height with a number:</p> <pre><code>define('IMAGE_WIDTH' 50); define('IMAGE_HEIGHT' 200); </code></pre> <p>But when I replace the value of the height with the variable the image does not output:</p> <pre><code>define('IMAGE_WIDTH' 50); define('IMAGE_HEIGHT' $cred0); </code></pre> <p>I am guessing the variable is not being passed into the the graphic draw .php page correctly.

35236247,Using kqueue for simple async io,<p>How does one actually use <code>kqueue()</code> for doing simple async r/w's?</p> <p>It's inception seems to be as a replacement for <code>epoll()</code> and <code>select()</code> and thus the problem it is trying to solve is scaling to listening on large number of file descriptors for changes.</p> <p>However if I want to do something like: <strong><em>read data from descriptor X let me know when the data is ready</em></strong> - how does the API support that? Unless there is a complimentary API for kicking-off non-blocking r/w requests I don't see a way other than managing a thread pool myself which defeats the purpose.</p> <p>Is this simply the wrong tool for the job? Stick with <code>aio</code>?</p> <p><strong>Aside:</strong> I'm not savvy with how modern BSD-based OS internals work - but is <code>kqueue()</code> built on <code>aio</code> or visa-versa? I would imagine it would depend on whether the OS io subsystem system is fundamentally interrupt-driven or polling. </p>,35238374,2,0,,2016-02-06 01:28:22.800 UTC,,2016-02-06 07:07:58.970 UTC,,,,user5709700,,,1,0,ios|osx|asynchronous|bsd,69
696646,Refactoring Crystal Reports: whether to to what and why?,<p>Report design generation and maintenance isn't hard but it is dull. We have a number of legacy (to quite different degrees of legacy) reports in Crystal Reports XI. These are designed for A4/PDF - not necessarily printed but to be of a predictable layout and there's no possibility of us retiring them any time soon. </p> <p>All connect to existing stored procedures (SQL Server 2005) to acquire their data. A lot of time has been sunk in getting these reports to look <em>just so</em>. The actual creation of reports is mostly done via the .NET/C# API and exported to PDF. There are a number of locally developed and maintained applications that are stable and handle this process well. </p> <p>So we like the fact that Crystal Reports is stable that our apps produce these reports reliably that the PDF output is consistent and that when the Crystal Reports template is approved and set it just works. </p> <p>There are some big problems with this situation though. The biggest being that any changes to the underlying report templates themselves are a huge pain; getting the Crystal Reports template to a point that users are happy is a royal hassle and can involve a long iteration of DTP/graphics/database/reconciliation and myriad other niggles. </p> <p>Combine that with Crystal Reports being a relatively rare skill and not one people want to admit to we are trying to think up alternative solutions. </p> <p>Some thoughts I've started to consider - and any others welcome! </p> <ul> <li>Does Crystal Reports 2008 offer any benefits over XI? </li> <li>How have others managed a migration away from CR? And what to? </li> <li>Given the data access layer is well formed perhaps generate graphs via an Excel service and then import them as graphics to a framework template? Crystal another - has anyone tried anything like this? </li> <li>Is Reporting Services any better? (We have some RS skillz but again another thing that people are loath to actually own up to knowing anything about.) </li> <li>Are there any layout tools available (preferably with a .NET API) for what in the old days would be called Desktop Publishing? If we have graphics/tables/other objects as images that could then be rendering automatically </li> </ul> <p>Ideally I want to move to a solution where the users are in greater control of the underlying changes and whether this can be handled programatically within tools that we can provide to them and so that I can be coding rather than editing Crystal Reports templates. </p>,714798,2,0,,2009-03-30 10:01:48.217 UTC,,2009-04-03 17:07:57.767 UTC,,,,Unsliced,2902,,1,0,layout|crystal-reports|reporting|graphing,368

Ideally I'd like the hosting process to get the connection string from the config file and pass it to a constructor for my service object DocumentInfoService which would hold onto it and use it to pass to business objects as needed.</p> <p>However the ServiceHost constructor takes a System.Type object -- so instances of DocumentInfoService are created via the default constructor.

656121,Is there a better way to work with Flex Builder and the AMF Gateway?,<p>I'm using Flex Builder 3 to connect to a bunch of back-end code via the AMF gateway. Another developer packaged up all the AMF Gateway code into a war file. Here's my development process: </p> <ul> <li>Deploy most recent AMF-gateway.war file into local jboss server</li> <li>War file gets unpacked into [jboss]/server/tmp/deploy/tmp23241AMF-gateway-exp.war/ </li> <li>Run Flex Builder. Point application project at AMF Gateway tmp folder in 3 places (Flex server root folder Flex build output folder Flex compiler 'additional arguments' (pointing to location of services-config.xml). </li> </ul> <p>This setup means that whenever you start a debug session in Flex Builder it dumps working versions of the files into the AMF-gateway folder on the jboss server (which is aliased as /AMF-gateway). The thing is every time I restart jboss or deploy an updated AMF-gateway.war file it gets unpacked into a new temp folder with a new name and I need to change all the references in the Flex project. This happens several times a day and it's annoying. Can I streamline this configuration?

14126654,I'm stuck with some reflection in my Java project,<p>I've been working on a Bukkit plugin project for a while and I've finally decided to make a formal release. So in my crazy scramble to document everything about my project I decided to clean up some APIs for people that would like to use them. Now I've hit the wall with a single problem though. </p> <p>Basically in this API you must implement an interface and then register your implementation with a class that manages every implementation and also checks for/registers another variable with the PluginMetrics that are bundled inside the plugin. </p> <p>Here is my interface with the name and tracker fields being fields of concern:</p> <pre><code>public interface IAction { /** * Name of the action. */ String name = null; /** * Stores args passed to the action by the player. */ String[] args = null; /** * Holds the Metrics tracker object. */ Tracker tracker = null; ... } </code></pre> <p>And here is the method (and init() method) where all my issues arise:</p> <pre><code>public static void registerAction(final Class a) { try { store.put((String) a.getField( name ).get(a) a); log.exDebug(String.format( Action %s (%s) was registered.  (String) a.getField( name ).get(a) a.getCanonicalName())); try { Tracker metric = (Tracker) a.getField( tracker ).get(a); try { OpenAuth.getMetrics().addCustomData(metric); log.exDebug(String.format( Registered Metrics data tracker [%s] from %s.  metric.getColumnName() a.getCanonicalName())); } catch (java.lang.Exception e) { log.info( Exception occurred while registering Action data tracker. ); } } catch (java.lang.Exception e) { log.info( Exception occurred while registering Action data tracker. ); // e.printStackTrace(); } } catch (java.lang.Exception e) { log.info( Exception occurred while registering an Action. ); e.printStackTrace(); } } public static void init() { for (Actions a : Actions.values()) { try { registerAction(a.getAction()); } catch (java.lang.Exception e) { log.info( Exception occurred while initialising Actions enumerator. ); e.printStackTrace(); } } for (Object ob : classLoader.load().getClasses()) { Class c = null; try { c = (Class) ob; } catch (java.lang.Exception e) { log.info( Exception occurred while casting up external Action. ); e.printStackTrace(); } try { registerAction(c); } catch (java.lang.Exception e) { log.info( Exception occurred while registering external Action. ); e.printStackTrace(); } } } </code></pre> <p>And an example implementation:</p> <pre><code>public class FreezeStick implements IAction { public static final String name = freeze ; public static final Tracker tracker = new Tracker( FreezeStick ); private String[] args = null; private Session attached; private SessionController sc; private final LogHandler log = new LogHandler(); private final String permissible = openauth.action.freeze ; private OAServer server; private boolean used = false; protected OAPlayer sender; protected OAPlayer target; public FreezeStick(OAServer server Session attached) { this.server = server; this.sc = server.getController().getSessionController(); this.attached = attached; this.setSender(this.attached.getPlayer()); } -- etc.. -- </code></pre> <p>Every time <code>Tracker metric = (Tracker) a.getDeclaredField( tracker ).get(a);</code> happens it's reported as <code>null</code>. I've tried with a.getField() instead of a.getDeclaredField() but same problem. Both the name and tracker variables receive <code>private static and final</code> when they are declared in the implementations and using a.getField() on the name variable has worked fine ever since I first wrote this.</p> <p>If someone could point me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it :) </p> <p>Also here is the exception that occurs if it helps with figuring out my problem any better:</p> <pre><code>2013-01-02 10:48:10 [INFO] [OpenAuth-debug] Action ban (me.maiome.openauth.actions.BanStick) was registered. 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [INFO] [OpenAuth] Exception occurred while adding Action data tracker. 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] java.lang.NullPointerException 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at me.maiome.openauth.actions.Actions.registerAction(Actions.java:65) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at me.maiome.openauth.actions.Actions.init(Actions.java:104) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at me.maiome.openauth.bukkit.OpenAuth.onEnable(OpenAuth.java:230) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at org.bukkit.plugin.java.JavaPlugin.setEnabled(JavaPlugin.java:217) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at org.bukkit.plugin.java.JavaPluginLoader.enablePlugin(JavaPluginLoader.java:457) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at org.bukkit.plugin.SimplePluginManager.enablePlugin(SimplePluginManager.java:381) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at org.bukkit.craftbukkit.v1_4_6.CraftServer.loadPlugin(CraftServer.java:278) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at org.bukkit.craftbukkit.v1_4_6.CraftServer.enablePlugins(CraftServer.java:260) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at org.bukkit.craftbukkit.v1_4_6.CraftServer.&lt;init&gt;(CraftServer.java:214) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at net.minecraft.server.v1_4_6.PlayerList.&lt;init&gt;(PlayerList.java:52) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at net.minecraft.server.v1_4_6.DedicatedPlayerList.&lt;init&gt;(SourceFile:11) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at net.minecraft.server.v1_4_6.DedicatedServer.init(DedicatedServer.java:104) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at net.minecraft.server.v1_4_6.MinecraftServer.run(MinecraftServer.java:399) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at net.minecraft.server.v1_4_6.ThreadServerApplication.run(SourceFile:849) </code></pre>,14166391,3,0,,2013-01-02 16:52:40.503 UTC,,2013-01-04 22:57:57.143 UTC,2013-01-02 18:20:52.147 UTC,,1943649,pirogoeth,1943649,,1,0,java|reflection,204

452390,Best way to organize a class hierarchy including an overridable Update function,<p>I have a base class Foo that has an Update() function which I want to be called once per frame for every instance of that class. Given an object instance of this class called foo  then once per frame I will call foo->Update().</p> <p>I have a class Bar derived from my base class that also needs to update every frame.</p> <p>I could give the derived class an Update() function but then I would have to remember to call its base::Update() function - nothing enforces my requirement that the base::Update() function is called because I have overriden it and could easily just forget to (or choose not to) call the base:Update function.</p> <p>So as an alternative I could give the base class a protected OnUpdate() function which could be made overrideable and call it from the base::Update() function. This removes the onus on me to remember to call base::Update() from the derived update function because I'm no longer overriding it. A Bar instance called bar will have bar->Update() called on it; this will first call the base class' Update() method which will in turn call the overriden OnUpdate() function performing the derived class' necessary updates.</p> <p>Which solves everything. Except. What if I want to derive yet another updatable class this time from the Bar class.</p> <p>Baz (which derives from Bar) also has update requirements. If I put them in Baz's OnUpdate() function I'm back to the original problem in that I'd have to remember to tell Baz's OnUpdate() function to call Bar's OnUpdate() function otherwise Bar's OnUpdate() function wouldn't get called.</p> <p>So really I'd want Bar's OnUpdate() function to be non-overridable and instead for it to call an overridable function after it has done whatever it needed to do perhaps called OnUpdate2()...</p> <p>And if I wanted to derive yet another class? OnUpdate3? OnUpdate4? AfterUpdate?</p> <p>Is there a Better Way?</p> <p><hr /></p> <p>Further Info:</p> <p>My specific problem domain is a 3d world. I've decided my base class is a Locator (an object with a location and orientation).</p> <p>My first derived class is a PhysicsObject - a Locator that also has mass velocity collision information etc.</p> <p>My next derived class is a Camera - which derives from PhysicsObject. As well as position and velocity it also has information about the viewport depth of field etc.</p> <p><hr /></p> <p>MattK suggests simplifying the hierarchy - if a Locator is never referred to incorporate it into PhysicsObject.</p> <p>I'm also thinking about how I would go about turning the layout upside down and using composition instead of inheritance.</p> <p>Perhaps a Camera HAS physics properties. Perhaps a PhysicsObject HAS a location.</p> <p>I'll have to think some more about this problem.</p> <p><hr /></p> <p>I like Uri's approach: Observe the contract. Here's the rule - please follow it. Uri is right in that whatever kind of safeguards I try to put in anyone could circumvent them so perhaps in this case the simplest solution is best. All my update() functions are going to have the requirement of calling their base::update() function.</p> <p>Thanks for the help everyone!</p>,452417,3,0,,2009-01-16 23:21:23.057 UTC,,2009-01-18 13:23:38.707 UTC,2009-01-18 13:23:38.707 UTC,Tim Gradwell,16676,Tim Gradwell,16676,,1,1,c++|design,323

From there it doesn't seem to work quite right:</p> <pre><code>class OperatorListener implements ActionListener { public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event) { String input = event.getActionCommand(); // Set display as string String s = display.getText(); if (!wait) { // Convert first input string to double try { value1 = Double.valueOf(s.trim()).doubleValue(); } catch (NumberFormatException nfe) { System.out.println( NumberFormatException: + nfe.getMessage()); } dec = false; } else { // Convert second input string to double try { value2 = Double.valueOf(s.trim()).doubleValue(); } catch (NumberFormatException nfe) { System.out.println( NumberFormatException: + nfe.getMessage()); } // Determine operation to be performed if (operator == add ) { value1 = Operators.add(value1 value2); } else if (operator == subtract ) { value1 = Operators.subtract(value1 value2); } else if (operator == multiply ) { value1 = Operators.multiply(value1 value2); } else if (operator == divide ) { value1 = Operators.divide(value1 value2); } // Convert final value to string and display display.setText(Double.toString(value1)); dec = false; } // Determine operator hit if (input.equals( + )) { operator = add ; } else if (input.equals( - )) { operator = subtract ; } else if (input.equals( x )) { operator = multiply ; } else if (input.equals( / )) { operator = divide ; } // Set wait wait = true; } } </code></pre> <p>EDIT: Updated code to fix some confusion and update the if statement.

282746,Connect to COM events in C# - support both managed and unmanaged servers,<p>I'm writing C# code that needs to connect to COM events. I implemented the use of IConnectionPointContainer and IConnectionPoint thus:</p> <pre><code> IConnectionPointContainer connectionPointContainer = internalGenerator as IConnectionPointContainer; if (connectionPointContainer == null) { Debug.Fail( The script generator doesn't support the required interface - IConnectionPointContainer ); throw new InvalidCastException( The script generator doesn't support the required interface - IConnectionPointContainer ); } Guid IID_IScriptGeneratorEvents = typeof(IScriptGeneratorCallback).GUID; connectionPointContainer.FindConnectionPoint(ref IID_IScriptGeneratorEvents out m_connectionPoint); m_connectionPoint.Advise(this out m_cookie); </code></pre> <p>The problem is that when the COM server is actually implemented in .Net (say C#) after .Net creates it it handles it as a .Net object not a COM object.

368832,Character encoding problem - PHP output read by .NET via HttpWebRequest,<p>I have a PHP script (running on a Linux server) that ouputs the names of some files on the server. It outputs these file names in a simple text-only format.</p> <p>This output is read from a VB.NET program by using HttpWebRequest HttpWebResponse and a StreamReader.</p> <p>The problem is that some of the file names being output contain... unusual characters. Specifically the section symbol (§). </p> <p>If I view the output of the PHP script in a web browser the symbol appears fine.</p> <p>But when I read the output of the PHP script into my .NET program the symbol doesn't appear correctly (it appears as a generic block symbol). </p> <p>I've tried all the different character encoding options that you can use when reading the response stream (from the HttpWebResponse). I've tried outputting the stream directly to a text file (no good) displaying it in a TextBox (no good) and even when viewing the results directly in the Visual Studio debugger the character appears as a block instead of as the section symbol. </p> <p>I've examined the output in a hex editor (as suggested by a related question <a href= http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29499/how-do-you-troubleshoot-character-encoding-problems >how do you troubleshoot character encoding problems</a>. </p> <p>When I write out the section symbol (§) from .NET itself the hex bytes I see representing it are c2 a7 (makes sense if it's unicode right? requires two bytes?). When I write out the output from the PHP script directly to a file and examine that with a hex editor the symbol shows up as ef bf bd - three bytes instead of two?</p> <p>I'm at a loss as to what to do - if I need to specify some other character encoding or if I'm missing something obvious about this. </p> <p>Here's the code that's used to get the output of the PHP script (VB-style comments modified so they appear correctly on this site):</p> <pre><code> Dim myRequest As HttpWebRequest = WebRequest.Create( http://www.example.com/sample.php ) Dim myResponse As HttpWebResponse = myRequest.GetResponse() // read the response stream Dim myReader As New StreamReader(myResponse.GetResponseStream()) // read the entire output in one block (just as an example) Dim theOutput as String = myReader.ReadToEnd() </code></pre> <p>Any ideas? </p> <ul> <li>Am I using the wrong kind of StreamReader? (I've tried passing the character encoding in the call to create the new StreamReader - I've tried all the ones that are in System.Text.Encoding - UTF-8 UTF-7 ASCII UTF-32 Unicode etc.)</li> <li>Should I be using a different method for reading the output of the PHP script? </li> <li>Is there something I should be doing different on the PHP-side when outputting the text?</li> </ul> <p><strong>UPDATED INFO:</strong></p> <ul> <li>The output from PHP is specifically encoded UTF-8 by calling: <code>utf8_encode($file);</code></li> <li>When I wrote out the symbol from .NET I copied and pasted the symbol from the Character Map app in Windows. I also copied &amp; pasted it directly from the file's name (in Windows) and from this web page itself - all gave the same hex value when written out (c2 a7).</li> <li>Yes the section symbol I'm talking about is U+00A7 (ALT+0167 on Windows according to Character Map).</li> <li>The content-type is set explicitly via <code>header('Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8');</code> right at the beginning of the PHP script.</li> </ul> <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p> <p>Figured it out myself but I couldn't have done it without the help from the people who answered.

709033,(network sockets) bytes stuck in Send Queue for 15 minutes; why?,<p>I have a Java program running on Windows (a Citrix machine) that dispatches a request to Java application servers on Linux; this dispatching mechanism is all custom.</p> <p>The Windows Java program (let's call it <code>W</code>) opens a listen socket to a port given by the OS say 1234 to receive results. Then it invokes a dispatch service on the server with a business request . This service splits the request and sends it to other servers (let's call them <code>S1 ... Sn</code>) and returns the number of jobs to the client synchronously.</p> <p>In my tests there are 13 jobs dispatched to a number of servers and within 2 seconds all servers have finished processing their jobs and try to send the results back to the <code>W</code>'s socket.</p> <p>I can see in the logs that 9 jobs are received by <code>W</code> (this number varies from test to test). So I try to look for the 4 remaining jobs. If I do a <code>netstat</code> on this Windows box I see that 4 sockets are open:</p> <pre><code>TCP W:4373 S5:48197 ESTABLISHED TCP W:4373 S5:48198 ESTABLISHED TCP W:4373 S6:57642 ESTABLISHED TCP W:4373 S7:48295 ESTABLISHED </code></pre> <p>If I do a thread dump of <code>W</code> I see 4 threads trying to read from these sockets and apparently stuck in <code>java.net.SocketInputStream.socketRead0(Native Method)</code>. </p> <p>If I go on each of the <code>S</code> boxes and do a <code>netstat</code> I see that some bytes are still in the Send Queue. This number of bytes does not move for 15 minutes. (The following is the aggregation of <code>netstat</code>s on the different machines):</p> <pre><code>Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address Foreign Addr State tcp 0 6385 S1:48197 W:4373 ESTABLISHED tcp 0 6005 S1:48198 W:4373 ESTABLISHED tcp 0 6868 S6:57642 W:4373 ESTABLISHED tcp 0 6787 S7:48295 W:4373 ESTABLISHED </code></pre> <p>If I do a thread dump of the servers I see the threads are also stuck in <code>java.net.SocketInputStream.socketRead0(Native Method)</code>. I would expect a write but maybe they're waiting for an ACK? (Not sure here; would it show in Java? Shouldn't it be handled by the TCP protocol directly?)</p> <p>Now the very strange thing is: after 15 minutes (and it's always 15 minutes) the results are received sockets are closed and everything continues as normal. </p> <p>This used to always work before. The <code>S</code> servers moved to a different data center so <code>W</code> and <code>S</code> are no longer in the same data center. Also <code>S</code> is behind a firewall. All ports should be authorized between <code>S</code> and <code>W</code> (I'm told). The mystery is really the 15 minute delay. I thought that it could be some protection against DDOS?</p> <p>I'm no network expert so I asked for help but nobody's available to help me. I spent 30 minutes with a guy capturing packets with Wireshark (formerly Ethereal) but for security reasons I cannot look at the result. He has to analyze this and get back to me. I asked for the firewall logs; same story.</p> <p>I'm not root or administrator on these boxes now I don't know what to do...

Objects created by new must be deleted which does two things (remember them): calls the destructor then frees the memory.</p> <p>FQA: Translation: delete is a way to explictly call a destructor but it also deallocates the memory. You can also call a destructor without deallocating the memory. It's ugly and useless in most cases but you can do that.</p> </blockquote> <p>The destructor/constructor call is obviously normal C++ code. Guarantees used in the code directly result from the in placement new guarantees. It is <strong>the core of the standard</strong> it's rock solid thing. How can it be called dirty and be presented as something unreliable?</p> <p>Do you think it's possible that the in-placement and non-in-placement implementation of new are different? I'm thinking about some sick possibility that the regular new can for example put size of the memory block allocated before the block which in-placement new obviously would not do (because it doesn't allocate any memory).

It's for learning ruby but I would like to put it up online for personal use. I have some experience with Rails and many here have recommended Sinatra.

469899,How does one databind a custom type to TextBox.Text?,<p>I have a custom c# type like (just an example):</p> <pre><code>public class MyVector { public double X {get; set;} public double Y {get; set;} public double Z {get; set;} //... } </code></pre> <p>And I want it to databind to TextBox.Text:</p> <pre><code>TextBox textBox; public MyVector MyVectorProperty { get; set;} //... textBox.DataBindings.Add( Text  this MyVectorProperty ); </code></pre> <p>Essentially I need conversion to and from a string for my custom value type. In the text box I want something like x y z that can be edited to update the vector type. I assumed that I could do so by adding a <code>TypeConverter</code> derived class:</p> <pre><code>public class MyVectorConverter : TypeConverter { public override bool CanConvertFrom(ITypeDescriptorContext context Type sourceType) { if (sourceType == typeof(string)) return true; //... return base.CanConvertFrom(context sourceType); } public override bool CanConvertTo(ITypeDescriptorContext context Type destinationType) { if (destinationType == typeof(string)) return true; //... return base.CanConvertTo(context destinationType); } public override object ConvertFrom(ITypeDescriptorContext context System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture object value) { if (value is string) { MyVector MyVector; //Parse MyVector from value return MyVector; } return base.ConvertFrom(context culture value); } public override object ConvertTo(ITypeDescriptorContext context System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture object value Type destinationType) { if (destinationType == typeof(string)) { string s; //serialize value to string s return s; } //... return base.ConvertTo(context culture value destinationType); } } </code></pre> <p>and associating it with my struct:</p> <pre><code>[TypeConverter(typeof(MyVectorConverter))] public class MyVector { //... } </code></pre> <p>This appears to complete half of the battle. I can see <code>MyVectorConverter</code> getting called into but something is amiss. It is called to see if it knows how to convert to string then it is called to convert to string. However it is never queried to see if it can convert FROM string nor to actually do the conversion. Furthermore right after an edit in the textbox the old value is immediately replaced (another CanConvertTo and ConvertTo sequence restoring the old value). The end result is that the newly typed entry in the text box is reverted immediately after it is applied. </p> <p>I feel as if there is just something simple missing. Is there? Is this entire project/approach doomed to failure? Does anyone else attempt such madness? How does one bi-directionally bind a custom multipart type to a string-based control?</p> <p><b>Solution:</b> Bizarrely all that is needed is for the formatting to be enabled on the Binding object.

301577,Why does Visual Studio 2008 forget where to dock my add-in's window pane?,<p>I wrote a simple add-in for Visual Studio 2008 that opens a dockable window pane. </p> <p><a href= http://www.codeplex.com/ora >You can download the source and a binary installer by clicking here.</a></p> <p>The nature of the add-in means that it is ideally going to stay docked next to where you edit your source. But sometimes on some installs it won't stay docked. You run VS you dock my pane you shutdown VS you restart VS and dang it - the pane is floating again. On some machines I have to re-dock it every time.</p> <p>But on other installs it stays docked wherever I put it forever. I originally thought it might be a difference between Vista and XP but now I have reports of it coming unstuck on XP as well.</p> <p>From what I've read (and the fact that it sometimes stays docked) I get the impression that VS is supposed to take care of saving the docking state for me. But it isn't doing that. And yet other plugins on the same VS install don't have this problem. So there has to be something I can do to improve the situation.</p> <p>I suspect the only relevant part of my code is this:</p> <pre><code>public class Connect : IDTExtensibility2 { private static DTE2 _applicationObject; private AddIn _addInInstance; private static CodeModelEvents _codeModelEvents; public static DTE2 VisualStudioApplication { get { return _applicationObject; } } public static CodeModelEvents CodeModelEvents { get { return _codeModelEvents; } } public static event EventHandler SourceChanged = delegate { }; public void OnConnection(object application ext_ConnectMode connectMode object addInInst ref Array custom) { _applicationObject = (DTE2)application; _addInInstance = (AddIn)addInInst; } public void OnStartupComplete(ref Array custom) { try { Events2 events = (Events2)_applicationObject.Events; _codeModelEvents = events.get_CodeModelEvents(null); object objTemp = null; Windows2 toolWins = (Windows2)_applicationObject.Windows; Window toolWin = toolWins.CreateToolWindow2( _addInInstance GetType().Assembly.Location Ora.OraPane  Ora  {DC8A399C-D9B3-40f9-90E2-EAA16F0FBF94}  ref objTemp); toolWin.Visible = true; } catch (Exception ex) { MessageBox.Show( Exception: + ex.Message); } } public void OnBeginShutdown(ref Array custom) { } public void OnDisconnection(ext_DisconnectMode disconnectMode ref Array custom) { } public void OnAddInsUpdate(ref Array custom) { } } </code></pre> <p>(The MSDN docs suggest that the window should be created in OnConnection but if I do that then the window mostly doesn't appear.)</p>,313046,4,0,,2008-11-19 11:05:02.083 UTC,3,2012-08-19 17:47:32.277 UTC,,,,Earwicker,27423,,1,8,visual-studio|visual-studio-2008|add-in|visual-studio-addins|docking,2667
160298,Django/Python - Grouping objects by common set from a many-to-many relationships,<p>This is a part algorithm-logic question (how to do it) part implementation question (how to do it best!). I'm working with Django so I thought I'd share with that.</p> <p>In Python it's worth mentioning that the problem is somewhat related to <a href= http://stackoverflow.com/questions/773/how-do-i-use-pythons-itertoolsgroupby >how-do-i-use-pythons-itertoolsgroupby</a>.</p> <p>Suppose you're given two Django Model-derived classes:</p> <pre><code>from django.db import models class Car(models.Model): mods = models.ManyToManyField(Representative) </code></pre> <p>and</p> <pre><code>from django.db import models class Mods(models.Model): ... </code></pre> <p>How does one get a list of Cars grouped by Cars with a common set of Mods?</p> <p>I.e. I want to get a class likeso:</p> <pre><code>Cars_by_common_mods = [ { mods: { 'a' } cars: { 'W1' 'W2' } } { mods: { 'a' 'b' } cars: { 'X1' 'X2' 'X3' } } { mods: { 'b' } cars: { 'Y1' 'Y2' } } { mods: { 'a' 'b' 'c' } cars: { 'Z1' } } ] </code></pre> <p>I've been thinking of something like:</p> <pre><code>def cars_by_common_mods(): cars = Cars.objects.all() mod_list = [] for car in cars: mod_list.append( { 'car': car 'mods': list(car.mods.all()) } ret = [] for key mods_group in groupby(list(mods) lambda x: set(x.mods)): ret.append(mods_group) return ret </code></pre> <p>However that doesn't work because (perhaps among other reasons) the groupby doesn't seem to group by the mods sets. I guess the mod_list has to be sorted to work with groupby. All to say I'm confident there's something simple and elegant out there that will be both enlightening and illuminating.</p> <p><em>Cheers &amp; thanks!</em></p>,161082,5,0,2008-10-01 23:59:52.723 UTC,2008-10-01 23:59:52.723 UTC,3,2008-10-07 14:17:42.883 UTC,2008-10-03 23:42:17.503 UTC,BMH,19212,BMH,19212,,1,5,python|django|algorithm|puzzle,2341

385327,What setting in vim counteracts smartindent's refusal to indent # comments in shell scripts?,<p>I recently started using vim 7 (previously vim 6) and the <code>smartindent</code> setting. For the most part it works well though I'm so used to typing a tab after an open brace that it is almost counter-productive.</p> <p>However there is one piece of maniacal behaviour. When editing a shell script I try to create a comment at the current indent level but <code>smartindent</code> will have nothing to do with it. It insists that the comment must be at level 0 (no indent). What's worse it breaks shift-right ('<code>&gt;&gt;</code>' and friends) so that they do not work. This is outright insubordination and I'd like to know what's the best way to fix it?</p> <p>(I'm also not keen on <code>smartindent</code>'s ideas about indenting <code>then</code> after <code>if</code>.)</p> <p>Preferred solutions will save me manual bashing - I'm being lazy. One option would be 'turn off <code>smartindent</code> when editing shell scripts (leave it on for the rest)'. Another option would be guidelines on how to find the control script for <code>smartindent</code> and what to edit to change the characteristics I don't like. The final option (which I don't need advice on how to do - just the hint that it is the best or only way to restore sanity) is to leave <code>smartindent</code> unset.</p> <p>I saw the vaguely related question on <a href= http://stackoverflow.com/questions/313359/annoying-vim-unindent-rules >(PHP and) annoying vim unindent rules</a> ; it doesn't provide me with the direct answer though maybe the <code>cindent</code> and related items mentioned in there are in fact part of the answer.</p>,385343,7,1,,2008-12-22 01:33:47.417 UTC,3,2010-02-24 04:47:45.447 UTC,,,,Jonathan Leffler,15168,,1,19,shell|vim|auto-indent,7412

Being a programmer I have poked and prodded with the system and found that it submits the username and password via a HTTP GET request. On the domain it is run on all computers are set to bypass the proxy so the URL with the request won't be saved in some proxy log somewhere. But I would argue this is an unsafe way of handling username and passwords anyway.</p> <p>The vendor will argue that since we never asked for it it will be an 'enhancement' which will require additional $$$. (We never wrote the specifications for the system in the first place).</p> <p>What kind of case could I make to management to make them feel this isn't to standard and that probably the only way this system would be secure is through HTTPS?</p> <p>EDIT: Thanks for all your responses! I have raised the issue with the project leader her response was along the lines of what's HTTP? . So I plan to explain it all to her in better detail investigate the legal implications and try to raise the issue with the programmers directly asking why they went that path.

493177,How can I profile file I/O?,<p>Our build is annoyingly slow. It's a Java system built with <a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Ant rel= nofollow >Ant</a> and I'm running mine on Windows XP. Depending on the hardware it can take between 5 to 15 minutes to complete. </p> <p>Watching overall performance metrics on the machine as well as correlating hardware differences with build times indicates that the process is I/O bound. It also shows that the process does a lot more reading than writing.</p> <p>However I haven't found a good way to determine <em>which</em> files are being read or written and how many times. My suspicion is that with our many subprojects and subsequent invocations of the compiler the build is re-reading the same commonly used libraries many times.</p> <p>What are some profiling tools that will tell me what a given process is doing with which files? Free is nice but not essential.</p> <hr> <p>Using <a href= http://stackoverflow.com/questions/493177/how-can-i-profile-file-i-o/493201#493201 >Process Monitor as suggested by Jon Skeet</a> I was able to confirm my suspicion: almost all of the disk activity was reading and re-reading of libraries with the JDK's copies of rt.jar and other libraries at the top of the list. I can't make a RAM disk large enough to hold all the libraries I used but mounting the hottest libraries on a RAM disk cut build times by about 40%; clearly Windows file system caching isn't doing a good enough job even though I've told Windows to optimize for that. </p> <p>One interesting thing I noticed is that the typical 'read' operation on a <a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAR_%28file_format%29 rel= nofollow >JAR</a> file is just a few dozen bytes; usually there are two or three of these followed by a skip several kilobytes further on in the file.

566186,JTable with a complex editor,<p>I have many custom editors for a JTable and it's an understatement to say that the usability particularly in regard to editing with the keyboard is lacking.</p> <p>The main reason for this is that my editors are always created with a similar (though often more complex) situation to this:</p> <pre><code>@Override public Component getTableCellEditorComponent(JTable table Object value boolean isSelected int row int column) { JPanel container = new JPanel(); container.setLayout(new BorderLayout()); container.add(field BorderLayout.CENTER); field.setText((String) value); container.add(new JButton( ... ) BorderLayout.EAST); return container; } </code></pre> <p>I.E a panel with more than one component inside. The actual text editor is a descendant of the component being returned as the editor. So rendering issues aside from what I can tell the JTable is focusing the component that is returned by the <code>getTableCellEditorComponent</code> method so when you press a key with a cell highlighted it passes focus and the key press to the panel thinking that's the editor.<br /> Is there anyway I can inform JTable that the real editor is the JTextfield? Adding a hacky <code>requestFocusInWindow</code> on the correct component is insufficient as the key press won't get passed on.</p>,577021,5,0,,2009-02-19 16:49:11.163 UTC,8,2012-11-15 21:09:51.333 UTC,,,,Tom Martin,5303,,1,8,java|user-interface|swing|editor|jtable,8959

86105,How can I supress the browser's authentication dialog?,<p>My web application has a login page that submits authentication credentials via an AJAX call. If the user enters the correct username and password everything is fine but if not the following happens:</p> <ol> <li>The web server determines that although the request included a well-formed Authorization header the credentials in the header do not successfully authenticate.</li> <li>The web server returns a 401 status code and includes one or more WWW-Authenticate headers listing the supported authentication types.</li> <li>The browser detects that the response to my call on the XMLHttpRequest object is a 401 and the response includes WWW-Authenticate headers. It then pops up an authentication dialog asking again for the username and password.</li> </ol> <p>This is all fine up until step 3. I don't want the dialog to pop up I want want to handle the 401 response in my AJAX callback function. (For example by displaying an error message on the login page.) I want the user to re-enter their username and password of course but I want them to see my friendly reassuring login form not the browser's ugly default authentication dialog.</p> <p>Incidentally I have no control over the server so having it return a custom status code (i.e. something other than a 401) is not an option.</p> <p>Is there any way I can suppress the authentication dialog? In particular can I suppress the Authentication Required dialog in Firefox 2 or later? Is there any way to suppress the Connect to <em>[host]</em> dialog in IE 6 and later?</p> <p><hr /></p> <p><strong>Edit</strong><br /> <em>Additional information from the author (Sept. 18):</em><br /> I should add that the real problem with the browser's authentication dialog popping up is that it give insufficient information to the user.</p> <p>The user has just entered a username and password via the form on the login page he believes he has typed them both correctly and he has clicked the submit button or hit enter. His expectation is that he will be taken to the next page or perhaps told that he has entered his information incorrectly and should try again. However he is instead presented with an unexpected dialog box.</p> <p>The dialog makes no acknowledgment of the fact he just <em>did</em> enter a username and password. It does not clearly state that there was a problem and that he should try again. Instead the dialog box presents the user with cryptic information like The site says: '<em>[realm]</em>'. Where <em>[realm]</em> is a short realm name that only a programmer could love.</p> <p>Web broswer designers take note: no one would ask how to suppress the authentication dialog if the dialog itself were simply more user-friendly. The <em>entire</em> reason that I am doing a login form is that our product management team rightly considers the browsers' authentication dialogs to be awful.</p>,90811,10,1,,2008-09-17 18:22:03.467 UTC,23,2016-05-24 11:16:30.793 UTC,2009-06-26 01:17:56.860 UTC,dgvid,52963,dgvid,9897,,1,55,javascript|ajax|http-authentication,31752

19438886,css: zoooming-out inside the browser moves rightmost floated div below other divs,<p>I am seeing something strange in both firefox and chrome when I increase the zoom level inside these browsers although I see nothing wrong with my CSS... I am hoping someone on this group will be able to help. Here is the whole story:</p> <p>I have a right-floated top-level div containing three right-floated right. The three inner divs have all box-model measurements in pixels which add up to the width of the enclosing container. Everything looks fine when the browser size is 100% but when I start making the browser smaller with CTRL+scrollwheel or CTRL+minus the rightmost margin shrinks down too fast and eventually becomes zero forcing my rightmost floated inner div to fall down below the other two!</p> <p>I can't make sense out of this almost seems like some integer division is being performed incorrectly in the browser code but alas firefox and chrome both display the same result.</p> <p>Here is the example (just zoom out with CTRL-minus to see what I mean):</p> <p><a href= http://timescapezone.com/test/test1/ rel= nofollow >Click Here to View What I Mean on Example Site</a></p> <p>Just to narrow things down a bit the tags of interest are the following:</p> <blockquote> <pre><code>div#mainContent div#contentLeft div#contentCenter div#contentRight </code></pre> </blockquote> <p>I've searched stackoverflow for an answer and found the following posts which seem related to my question but was not able to apply them to the problem I am experiencing:</p> <blockquote> <p>http:// stackoverflow.com/questions/6955313/div-moves-incorrectly-on-browser-resize</p> <p>http:// stackoverflow.com/questions/18246882/divs-move-when-resizing-page</p> <p>http:// stackoverflow.com/questions/17637231/moving-an-image-when-browser-resizes</p> <p>http:// stackoverflow.com/questions/5316380/how-to-stop-divs-moving-when-the-browser-is-resized</p> </blockquote> <p>I've duplicated the html and css code below for your convenience:</p> <p>Here is the HTML:</p> <pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta charset= utf-8 &gt; &lt;title&gt;Pinco&lt;/title&gt; &lt;link href= css/style.css rel= stylesheet type= text/css &gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;div id= wrapper &gt; &lt;header&gt; &lt;div class= logo &gt; &lt;a href= http://pinco.com &gt; &lt;img class= logo src= images/PincoLogo5.png alt= Pinco /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class= titolo &gt; &lt;h1&gt;Benvenuti!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Siete arrivati al sito pinco.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;nav&gt; &lt;ul class= menu &gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= # &gt;Menù Qui&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= # &gt;Menù Quo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= # &gt;Menù Qua&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/nav&gt; &lt;/header&gt; &lt;div id= mainContent &gt; &lt;div id= contentLeft &gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;article&gt; &lt;p&gt; Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing elit.

One solution is to do the following:</p> <pre><code>div#contentRight { height: 900px; float: left; margin: 0 0 /* 15px */ 0 15px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 15px; width: 268px; background: #ccc; } </code></pre> <p>so that now the right column has no right margin but the visual result is the same. Now when I zoom out the rightmost column does not fall down but its right margin is so small compared to the others so really there is still a small problem.</p> <h2><strong>Edit 2:</strong></h2> <p>OK I've done some more searching and found an even better solution. The solution consists in having the margins in between the div column elements the same and having the left and right margin adjust automatically. In order to achieve this I had to do away with floats and use display: inline-block which IMHO is much more suitable than floats and was designed for the purpose at hand:</p> <pre><code>div#mainContent { padding: 15px 0; width: 960px; text-align: center; } div#contentLeft { display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; height: 900px; margin: 0 0 0 0/*15px*/; border: 1px solid black; padding: 15px; width: 268px; background: #ccc; } div#contentCenter { display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; height: 900px; margin: 0 0 0 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; padding: 15px; width: 268px; background: #E00; } div#contentRight { display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; height: 900px; margin: 0 0/* 15px */ 0 15px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 15px; width: 268px; background: #ccc; } </code></pre> <p>div#mainContent section { text-align: justify; }</p> <p>Now at a normal zoom level all left margins will be 15px plus the last element's right margin which will also be 15px. On the other hand if I zoom out there is some pixel rounding going on but the rounding is applied more or less equally on both sides which is somewhat better. This works in Firefox.</p> <h2><strong>Edit 3:</strong></h2> <p>Alas I've tried reducing the in-between margins a bit which makes the problem go away with Chrome but one of the div elements still drops down in IE10.</p> <pre><code>div#mainContent { padding: 15px 0; text-align: center; } div#contentLeft { display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; height: 900px; margin: 0 0 0 0/* 20px increased from 15px */; border: 1px solid black; padding: 15px; width: 268px; background: #ccc; overflow: hidden; } div#contentCenter { display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; height: 900px; margin: 0 0 0 10px/* reduced from 15px */; border: 1px solid transparent; padding: 15px; width: 268px; background: #E00; overflow: hidden; } div#contentRight { display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; height: 900px; margin: 0 0/* 20px increased from 15px */ 0 10px/* reduced from 15px */; border: 1px solid black; padding: 15px; width: 268px; background: #ccc; overflow: hidden; } div#mainContent section { text-align: justify; } </code></pre> <h2><strong>Edit 4:</strong></h2> <p>I've come up with a solution which works in Firefox Chrome and IE10. Basically I've created three div wrappers around the three columns and taken measurements again ensuring all measurements are symmetric. Here is the source code:</p> <p>HTML File:</p> <pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta charset= utf-8 &gt; &lt;title&gt;Pinco&lt;/title&gt; &lt;link href= css/style.css rel= stylesheet type= text/css &gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;div id= wrapper &gt; &lt;header&gt; &lt;div class= logo &gt; &lt;a href= http://pinco.com &gt; &lt;img class= logo src= images/PincoLogo5.png alt= Pinco /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class= titolo &gt; &lt;h1&gt;Benvenuti!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Siete arrivati al sito pinco.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;nav&gt; &lt;ul class= menu &gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= # &gt;Menù Qui&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= # &gt;Menù Quo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= # &gt;Menù Qua&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/nav&gt; &lt;/header&gt; &lt;div id= mainContent &gt; &lt;div id= wrapperLeft &gt; &lt;div id= contentLeft &gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;article&gt; &lt;p&gt; Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing elit.

596970,CSS: Simulating flexible width (without min-width)-,<p>I have a DIV container of 100% width holding x divs. The last child DIV floats right the rest float left. All child DIV's remain in a line so long as they fit in the bar (all oriented left except for the last div which sits by itself on the right). If the window is resized smaller and the children don't have enough room they collapse from their horizontal orientation (which I don't want). To fix this I know I can set a min-width of the DIV container the issue is that there is a variable amount of DIVs in the container of variable width. I'd like to simulate being able to set a min-width where of the container where min-width = width of all children but I cannot compute these because they are variable (which would simulate flexible space between the right div and the rest but not let them get closer than they should be allowed (hence collapsing the divs)).</p> <p>I know this is a little unclear so here's a picture: <img src= http://i.stack.imgur.com/sCVxE.jpg alt= http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/933/barfuo.jpg ></p> <p>Thanks!</p>,597004,1,0,,2009-02-27 22:44:19.860 UTC,,2013-07-20 02:17:07.543 UTC,2013-07-20 02:17:07.543 UTC,,2556654,Nic,72065,,1,5,css,6160

14073723,How to get a screen switch be fling in android?,<p>I am creating an Android app and would like to provide several layouts that can be switched by flinging (like Android home screens). I got the layouts to switch be flinging using this code:</p> <pre><code>public boolean onFling(MotionEvent e1 MotionEvent e2 float velocityX float velocityY) { if (e1.getX() - e2.getX() &gt; SWIPE_MIN_DISTANCE) { //vFlipper is a ViewFlipper but it is not important for me to have it. As long as I can display several layouts and switch them by thumb touch in a way that the layout will follow the thumb that's fine. if (vFlipper.getDisplayedChild() == 0) return false; vFlipper.setInAnimation(AnimationUtils.loadAnimation(this R.anim.left_in)); vFlipper.setOutAnimation(AnimationUtils.loadAnimation(this R.anim.left_out)); vFlipper.showPrevious(); } else if (e2.getX() - e1.getX() &gt; SWIPE_MIN_DISTANCE) { if (vFlipper.getDisplayedChild() == vFlipper.getChildCount() - 1) return false; vFlipper.setInAnimation(AnimationUtils.loadAnimation(this R.anim.right_in)); vFlipper.setOutAnimation(AnimationUtils.loadAnimation(this R.anim.right_out)); vFlipper.showNext(); } return true; } </code></pre> <p>but this doesn't work quite like the home screen. On the home screen you can pull the screen to the side and see it moving not having to complete the fling and switch the screen. The screen moves with your thumb. My code checks for a complete fling gesture and then fires the switching and the animation. Now I realize a full solution will probably drop the GestureDetector and the onFling method and use the onMove event but I don't know how to implement it and what to put in the onMove method. If you know of a good clear demonstration of this video or written a link will be most appreciated. If you don't care writing such a demonstration that will also be appreciated.</p>,14073851,1,2,,2012-12-28 18:02:05.103 UTC,,2012-12-28 18:12:33.483 UTC,,,,user1545072,,,1,0,android|touch|homescreen|onfling,197

450933,How to make a visual studio add-in that cannot be unloaded?,<p>I'm writing a Visual Studio add-in using C/C++. I am not familiar with the COM architecture. In fact I'm learning Windows programming. </p> <p>I can see an OnDisconnect() call back into my add-in. I tried returning S_FALSE but that does not seem to stop the add-in from being unloaded. </p> <p>So my questions is is it possible to make an add-in that cannot be unloaded (either through the Tools menu or programatically) and if yes will some magic return value from OnDisconnect() do the job or some other trick is required?</p> <p>I also saw another <a href= http://stackoverflow.com/questions/346674/visual-studio-and-add-in-unloading >question</a> that asks exactly the opposite. From the answer it seems that the DLL still resides in the memory when an add-in is unloaded. So maybe there is a way to reload the add-in as soon as it is unloaded? </p>,456164,1,6,,2009-01-16 16:09:38.420 UTC,,2009-01-18 23:59:33.940 UTC,,,,PolyThinker,47707,,1,0,visual-studio|visual-c++|add-in,160

Web development for an established site (at least in our case) consists of developing 'enhancements' (of various sizes) and many small 'fixes'. Deploying (to web) only at the end of the sprint would slow down our deployment of large enhancements (probably a good thing) but would dramatically slow down our deployment of small enhancements and fixes (i.e. the bugs hang around longer).</p> <p>Are mid-sprint deployments heretical in scrum?

57194,FTP Timeout on NLST when directory is empty,<p>EDIT: Learned that Webmethods actually uses NLST not LIST if that matters</p> <p>Our business uses the WebMethods integration server to handle most of our outbound communications and its FTP functionality leaves something to be desired. We are having a problem that may be specific to WebMethods but if anyone can point me in a direction of what kinds of things might cause this I'd appreciate it.</p> <p>When polling two of our partners' FTP servers we connect without issue but when doing a NLST on a directory that is empty (no files and no subdirectories) it's timing out. The actual error is:</p> <blockquote> <p>com.wm.net.ftpCException: [ISC.0064.9010] java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Accept timed out</p> </blockquote> <p>It's being thrown during the invocation of the pub.client.ftp:ls service. I've logged in with a number of FTP clients without a problem to the same sites. I've used whatever the default FTP client is in windows FileZilla and lftp. All without issue. The servers themselves aren't the same FTP server software from what I can tell. One is Microsoft FTP the other I'm uncertain on but is definitely not Microsoft.</p> <p>Any idea what could cause an FTP client to timeout when waiting for a NLST response on an empty directory? The visible responses from the FTP server appear to be the same but is there a difference in how NLST responds for an empty directory that I'm unaware of?</p> <p>This problem is consistent on these two servers. Everything functions fine on directories with files or subdirectories within it but not when empty.</p> <p>Any thoughts or directions would be appreciated.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> <p>Eric Sipple</p>,91422,5,1,,2008-09-11 17:51:19.817 UTC,,2011-12-19 18:44:46.553 UTC,2011-12-19 18:44:46.553 UTC,saalon,1104926,saalon,111,,1,1,java|ftp|webmethods,4556

277187,Is there a more Pythonic way to merge two HTML header rows with colspans?,<p>I am using BeautifulSoup in Python to parse some HTML. One of the problems I am dealing with is that I have situations where the colspans are different across header rows. (Header rows are the rows that need to be combined to get the column headings in my jargon) That is one column may span a number of columns above or below it and the words need to be appended or prepended based on the spanning. Below is a routine to do this. I use BeautifulSoup to pull the colspans and to pull the contents of each cell in each row. longHeader is the contents of the header row with the most items spanLong is a list with the colspans of each item in the row. This works but it is not looking very Pythonic. </p> <p>Alos-it is not going to work if the diff is &lt;0 I can fix that with the same approach I used to get this to work.

In my specific case the format of my procs will always be boolean tests on instance variables like this:</p> <pre><code>{@x == x &amp;&amp; @y != y || @z == String} </code></pre> <p>I wrote a method that builds classes dynamically and creates instance variables set to specified values:</p> <pre><code>def create_proc_tester(property_value_hash) new_class = Class.new.new new_class.class.class_eval do define_method(:xql?) { |&amp;block| instance_eval &amp;block } end property_value_hash.each do |key value| new_class.instance_variable_set( @#{key}  value) end new_class end </code></pre> <p>Which could be used something like this:</p> <pre><code>class Foo attr_accessor :block end foo = Foo.new foo.block = proc {@x == x &amp;&amp; @y != y || @z == String} tester = create_proc_tester(:x =&gt; x  :y =&gt; y  :z =&gt; Fixnum) puts Test #1: #{tester.xql? &amp;foo.block} tester = create_proc_tester(:x =&gt; x  :y =&gt; x  :z =&gt; String) puts Test #2: #{tester.xql? &amp;foo.block} &gt; Test #1: false &gt; Test #2: true </code></pre> <p>.<br> .<br> That's all great and wonderful but I want to know if there is a better more meta way to do this that actually tests the contents of the proc not just a work around that solves my specific problem; something that could be used to test any proc.</p> <p>I was thinking there might be a way to use the Ruby parser to get something to compare but I have no idea how.

13250333,GWT CSS choices: which to use when and why?,<p>So far I've accounted for four (4) different places where a GWT developer can inject CSS into a web application:</p> <ol> <li>Inside an HTML host page you can place an HTML link to an external stylesheet such as having <code>MyWebApp/war/hello_gwt.html</code> containing the following line: <code>&lt;link type= text/css rel= stylesheet href= mywebapp/webModule.css &gt;</code></li> <li>Through the use of implementing <code>ClientBundle</code>s that give your app access to binded <code>CssResource</code> subclasses</li> <li>Via UI Binder XML</li> <li>You can include theme/styling in your gwt.xml file like <code>&lt;inherits name= com.google.gwt.user.theme.standard.Standard /&gt;</code></li> </ol> <p>I'm confused about what job each one of these four is supposed to accomplish. In other words how do these CSS mechanisms work together to provide a web app with all the styling it needs or are they just different ways of accomplishing the same thing? Do they each have different pros/cons in different scenarios and if so what are they?</p> <p>I like the strategy of using a <code>Layout</code> or <code>LayoutPanel</code> to position the major display regions of my app and then using CSS to style the individual regions containers etc. So it seems like the first case above (HTML external CSS link) would <em>not</em> be something I'd be looking for seeing that I would want to customize the CSS for each new widget as my UI evolves.</p> <p>I guess I'm just looking for a litmus to go by when trying to choose between my CSS options in GWT-land.

634011,Is mobile OSGi ready for real world usage on mobile phones?,<p>I'm developing applications for mobile devices. I've never developed for OSGi and right now I'm considering to get started with it.</p> <p>I've read a lot about using OSGi on mobile phones and it's said to run on J2ME Symbian Windows Mobile Android... But to me it seems as if nobody currently uses it there. </p> <p>I really would like to exploit the many benefits of OSGi but I know I could do it without. And I don't want to exclude any users who are not able to use OSGi on their phone or would have to go through complicated setup processes make their phones ready for OSGi.</p> <p>And I just can't believe that most of those cheap J2ME phones can run something sophisticated as OSGi. Not talking 'bout $1000 smartphones but rather about those consumer devices you can get from e.g. Sony Ericsson for $100 (or $200 to be fair).</p> <p><strong>Is mobile OSGi a real alternative right now or is it only a nice perspective for future use?</strong></p> <p><strong>Edit:</strong> Until now there's only one answer and it states that we're far away from using mobile OSGi. But for me one answer is to few to base important decisions upon so I hope a bounty will attract some more readers. </p> <p>If no more answers will arrive then that's a sign that nobody has experience with mobile OSGi and then I would conclude the I wouldn't want to be the first one to explore it.

284732,Looking for SVN Best Practices When Building Rails Applications on Ubuntu,<p><strong>First a bit of background.</strong> </p> <p>I have been working on the MS platform for my entire development career. Up until 2 weeks ago I had never booted any other OS than 98/XP/Vista. I started using VSS long long ago and made the change to SVN about 2 years ago. With SVN I use TortiseSVN and use the standard branch/tag/trunk setup.</p> <p>My projects are also self contained meaning I can go to a fresh dev box pull down a single repository open VS press F5 and it will run (most of the time). All dependencies are stored in a <code>lib</code> folder source code is in a <code>src</code> folder etc...</p> <p>In an effort to learn new things I've decided to build a Ruby on Rails application and have created a Ubuntu based development machine. I have a SVN server up and running and am working with another person on this project. He happens to be using a Mac for his development machine.</p> <p><strong>And now for the issues.</strong></p> <p>I seem to be struggling with how to manage the various versions of ruby rails and all of the plugin's I'm working with. I also seem to be struggling with using SVN on Ubuntu. </p> <p>So Ubuntu comes with Ruby pre-installed. I want to say it's version 1.8.5. Either way I had a bunch of gems to install for the plugin I'm using (Community Engine). Being new to *nix I didn't use <code>sudo</code> when installing them and ran into all sorts of issues. I ended up blowing away Ruby completely and starting fresh. That seemed to work.</p> <p>The problem is though that after I commit my code and the other guy gets latest he has to go through the whole process of installing gems.</p> <p><strong>What is the best practice for managing gems and plug-ins in a RoR application?</strong> I don't care if a zillion files get added to SVN. Diskspace and network bandwidth are cheap. I just don't know how to do this correctly.</p> <p>So on to SVN.</p> <p>I have installed RapidSVN but very frequently run into issues with folders getting locked. A couple times I realized my mistake others I had no clue why. But in both scenarios i couldn't fix it. I ended up making a backup of my code pulling down a new working copy then manually moving over changes and being a bit smarter when committing them to the project.</p> <p>I actually RTFM a bit last night and found that I'm supposed to create a bookmark for my repos then do a checkout working copy from that bookmark. I'm not sure why but ok that's what the manual says...</p> <p><strong>What are some best practices for using SVN on a RoR project on Ubuntu?</strong></p> <p>I'm literally looking for a step by step process on this one.</p> <p><em>edit</em> I forgot to mention I use NetBeans for my IDE although i have not looked to see what kind of SVN support it has if any.

376943,,<p>The logic needn't be in your view but it's certainly not in the resource model the DotNet framework. Yours is a simple enough case that you can probably get away with creating a simple format string for singular and one for plural. You have 1 car. / You have {0} cars. You then need to write a method that discriminates between the plural and singular case.</p> <p>To the best of my knowledge there isn't a language that requires something more complicated than singular/plural but there may be some where expressing the equivalent of you have 0 cars doesn't sound right. There are also a number of languages where there's no distinction between singular and plural but this just requires a little duplication in the resource strings. (edit to add: gender and sometimes endings change depending on number of units in many languages but this should be fine as long as you distinguish between singular and plural sentences rather than just words).</p> <p>Microsoft mostly gave up on semantically clever localization because it's hard to generalize even something like pluralization to 30+ languages.

499043,,<p>First i believe you originally mean to return</p> <pre><code>StaticVector&lt;N&gt; </code></pre> <p>Instead of always a specialization with N==3 . So what you want to do is writing it like this:</p> <pre><code>template &lt;unsigned int N&gt; class StaticVector { public: // because of the injected class-name we can refer to us using // StaticVector . That is we don't need to name all template // parameters like StaticVector&lt;N&gt;. static StaticVector create3dVec(double x1 double x2 double x2) { // create a new empty StaticVector return StaticVector(); } }; </code></pre> <p>If you really want to always return a 3dVector you would probably want to restrict it to N==3 so that for example <code>StaticVector&lt;4&gt;::create3dVec</code> doesn't work. You can do that using the technique described <a href= http://stackoverflow.com/questions/347096/how-can-i-get-a-specialized-template-to-use-the-unspecialized-version-of-a-member/347107#347107 ><strong>here</strong></a>.</p> <p>If you want to have a function like <code>createVec</code> that works with any size you probably want to replace the parameters with an array. You can do otherwise but that's advanced and requires some macro tricks applied with boost::preprocessor. It's not worth it i think. The next C++ version will provide <em>variadic templates</em> for this purpose. Anywayconsider using something like this:</p> <p>I think it would only complicate this unnecessarily here. A quick solution is to use a boost::fusion::vector instead putting it into the class template instead of the version above:</p> <pre><code>static StaticVector createVec(double (&amp;values)[N]) { // create a new empty StaticVector initializing it // with the given array of N values. return StaticVector(); } </code></pre> <p>You could use it with</p> <pre><code>double values[3] = {1 2 3}; StaticVector&lt;3&gt; v = StaticVector&lt;3&gt;::createVec(values); </code></pre> <p>Note that it accepts an array by reference. You can't give it a pointer. That is because it matches the use of parameters: You couldn't provide less or more arguments for the other way too. It will also protect you from cases like this:</p> <pre><code>// oops values is a null pointer! StaticVector&lt;3&gt; v = StaticVector&lt;3&gt;::createVec(values); </code></pre> <p>An array never can be a null pointer. Of course if you like you can always change the array parameter to a pointer. It would just be my personal preference :)</p>,,,0,,2009-01-31 15:49:43.910 UTC,,2009-01-31 16:03:24.990 UTC,2009-01-31 16:03:24.990 UTC,litb,34509,litb,34509,498757,2,0,,

These factors might have an effect.</p> <p>Also consider that people might have started developing their product before an older version of the framework came out. In a lot of cases if your application is a .NET 2.0 application you may not need anything in the 3.x framework.

292713,,<p>As others have said - it depends.</p> <p>If the recoding is non-trivial then you are faced with a dilemma when the original lang.x library changes -- do you re-port the updated version and how can you do so?</p> <p>In general it is better to write a library wrapper in lang.y that calls down to the lang.x library. That way you get to use the good features of lang.y in the code that 'really' uses the library and you only have to worry about the mess in the interface code. The chances are that a stable library won't change its interfaces all that often (not every release) so you'll be able to upgrade the lang.x library without having to recode the wrapper code. And when you do need to enhance the wrapper code it will generally be a simple exercise to add the new functions or modify the one or two interfaces that change.</p> <p>The alternative is to become a maintainer of the library in lang.y. You would have to undertake the editing of your lag.y implementation in parallel with the lang.x implementation. You might do this informally (that is you and your employer might be the only beneficiaries -- watch the licencing terms on the library!) or formally by becoming a member of the library's development team. You could then influence the design of the library so that it is easier for your lang.y implementation to stay synchronized with the lang.x implementation.</p> <p><strong>Summary</strong>: leave the library in its original language as long as possible. Be cautious about doing the conversion unless you are willing to do the necessary maintenance.</p>,,,0,,2008-11-15 16:16:35.577 UTC,,2008-12-09 18:18:56.397 UTC,2008-12-09 18:18:56.397 UTC,Jonathan Leffler,15168,Jonathan Leffler,15168,292536,2,2,,

308092,,<p>This isn't a matter of OO principles in my view - it's up to the platform in question how it handles this particular conundrum. Calling a virtual method from a constructor is discouraged for precisely this reason however - if you're going to do it you need to document <em>very</em> explicitly that you're going to call it so that any class overriding it knows what to expect.</p> <p>Java takes the same approach as .NET <em>except</em> that in C# any instance variable initializers are executed before the base constructor call is made. This means that in your particular example you can fix the code by initializing <code>random</code> at the point of declaration. In Java that wouldn't help.</p> <p>As for why MC++ <em>doesn't</em> work this way I don't know - I suggest you compare the IL generated. My guess is that it explicitly makes a non-virtual method call.</p> <p>EDIT: I suspect I misread the question - which way does MC++ work?

265219,,<p>I had great success with this <a href= http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PassiveScreen.html rel= nofollow >Passive Screen</a> pattern.</p> <p>In my opinion the big problem of the traditional MVC architecture is that people stuff way too much into the form classes. This increases the amount of manual testing you have to do.</p> <p>The more automated testing you can do after you compile the more bugs you will catch at your desk. In a complex application the side effects from even minor changes occur all too often.</p> <p>The trick to solving this is making a controller assembly that the form assembly (or EXE) references. Every form has a corresponding class in the assembly. Clicking a button will call <code>ThisForm.ThisButton(&lt;args&gt;)</code> which will then fire objects lower in your framework. Each form implements an interface so that if the controller class needs additional information from the form it has a interface to retrieve it.</p> <p>Then for your <a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing rel= nofollow >unit testing</a> you simulate an operator performing complex operations by implementing dummy classes to fire events and feed information to the controller classes. The controller classes don't know any different as the dummy classes implement all the expected interfaces.</p> <p>There is an important exception and that is for trivial dialogs. For dialogs that have a few check boxes I feel this organization is overkill. I use the <a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_Pattern rel= nofollow >command pattern</a> a lot.

Something which is allocated once on first use and freed on program exit will sometimes be shown up by a leak-detector because it started counting before that first use. But it's not a leak (although it may be bad design since it may be some kind of global).</p> <p>To see whether a given chunk of code leaks you might reasonably run it once then clear the leak-detector then run it again (this of course requires programmatic control of the leak detector). Things which leak once per run of the program usually don't matter. Things which leak every time they're executed usually do matter eventually.</p> <p>I've rarely found it too difficult to hit zero on this metric which is equivalent to observing creeping memory usage as opposed to lost blocks. I had one library where it got so fiddly with caches and UI furniture and whatnot that I just ran my test suite three times over and ignored any leaks which didn't occur in multiples of three blocks. I still caught all or almost all the real leaks and analysed the tricky reports once I'd got the low-hanging fruit out of the way. Of course the weaknesses of using the test suite for this purpose are (1) you can only use the parts of it that don't require a new process and (2) most of the leaks you find are the fault of the test code not the library code...</p>,,,0,,2008-10-24 12:46:33.953 UTC,,2008-10-24 12:52:42.787 UTC,2008-10-24 12:52:42.787 UTC,onebyone.livejournal.com,13005,onebyone.livejournal.com,13005,233258,2,11,,

The article also goes over detecting dead fields and types.</p> <p><em>(EDIT: made answer more understandable)</em></p> <hr> <p>EDIT 11th June 2012: <em>Explain new NDepend facilities concerning unused code. Disclaimer: I am one of the developer of this tool.</em></p> <p>Since NDepend v4 released in May 2012 the tool proposes to write <a href= http://codebetter.com/blogs/patricksmacchia/archive/2008/02/15/code-metrics-on-coupling-dead-code-design-flaws-and-re-engineering.aspx rel= nofollow >Code Rule over LINQ Query (CQLinq)</a>. Around <a href= http://www.ndepend.com/DefaultRules/webframe.html rel= nofollow >200 default code rules</a> are proposed 3 of them being dedicated to <em>unused/dead code</em> detection:</p> <ul> <li><a href= http://www.ndepend.com/DefaultRules/webframe.html?Q_Potentially_dead_Types.html rel= nofollow >Potentially dead Types</a> (hence detect unused class struct interface delegate...)</li> <li><strong><a href= http://www.ndepend.com/DefaultRules/webframe.html?Q_Potentially_dead_Methods.html rel= nofollow >Potentially dead Methods</a></strong> (hence detect unused method ctor property getter/setter...)</li> <li><a href= http://www.ndepend.com/DefaultRules/webframe.html?Q_Potentially_dead_Fields.html rel= nofollow >Potentially dead Fields</a></li> </ul> <p>These CQLinq code rules are more powerful than the previous CQL ones. If you click these 3 links above toward the source code of these rules you'll see that the ones concerning types and methods are a bit complex. This is because they detect not only unused types and methods but also types and methods used <em>only</em> by unused dead types and methods (recursive).</p> <p>This is <em>static analysis</em> hence the prefix <em>Potentially</em> in the rule names. If a code element is used <em>only</em> through reflection these rules might consider it as unused which is not the case. </p> <p>In addition to using these 3 rules I'd advise measuring code coverage by tests and striving for having full coverage. Often you'll see that code that cannot be covered by tests is actually <em>unused/dead</em> code that can be safely discarded. This is especially useful in complex algorithms where it is not clear if a branch of code is reachable or not.</p>,,,0,,2008-09-16 12:59:41.240 UTC,,2012-06-11 19:25:57.590 UTC,2012-06-11 19:25:57.590 UTC,sixlettervariables,27194,sixlettervariables,7116,71518,2,15,,

Games tend to be such specialized applications that it's near impossible to give any one size fits all answers. What works great for Tetris is going to be useless with Asteroids and a model that works perfectly for Halo is likely to fail miserably for Mario.</p> <p>You'll also find quickly that there's no such thing as an industry standard for texture mesh level sound or animation formats. Everyone just rolls their own or uses whatever is convenient to the platform. You do occasionally see things like <a href= http://www.collada.org >COLLADA</a> which is nice but it's still just an intermediate format designed to make writing exporters easier.</p> <p>If you're new to game development my advice would be this: Don't kill yourself over your code structure on your first go. Try a simple game like asteroids and just hack away until it works no matter how ugly the code is. Use simple formats that you are familiar with without worrying about how well they'll hold up in larger projects. Don't worry about plugins skins editors or any of that other fluff. Just make it WORK! Then when you're done with that first all important game pick another and this time around clean up one or two aspects of your code (but don't go overboard!) From there iterate! </p> <p>I promise you that this will get you farther faster than any amount of poking around online for the right way ever could (this coming from someone who's done a LOT of poking).</p> <p>And one last thought for you: If you feel more comfortable working in a more well defined space take a look at <a href= http://creators.xna.com/ >XNA</a> or a similar library. They'll pre-define some of the best formats to use and give you tools to work with them which takes some of the initial guesswork out.</p> <p>Good luck and above all else remember: Games (and their development) are supposed to be FUN!

633189,,<p>For me here is what I like/dislike about Spring and auto-wiring.</p> <p>Pros:</p> <ul> <li>Auto-wiring gets rid of nasty XML configuration.</li> <li>Much easier to use annotations which allows you to inject directly using fields setter methods or constructors. Also allows you to annotate and 'qualify' your injected beans.</li> </ul> <p>Cons:</p> <ul> <li>Using auto-wiring and annotations makes you dependent on Spring libraries where as with XML configuration you could chose to run with or without Spring. Like you said you become tied to a DI framework.</li> <li>At the same time I like being able to 'qualify' beans to me this makes the code really messy. If you need to inject the same bean in multiple places I've seen the same string name repeated all over. To me this seems to have the potential for errors.</li> </ul> <p>I've started using auto-wiring almost exclusively at work because we depend so much on Spring integration anyway that the dependency issue is moot. I worked on a Spring MVC project that used auto-wiring extensively and was a little hard to wrap my head around.</p> <p>I think auto-wiring is an acquired taste once you get used to it you realize how powerful easy and much less of a headache it is to work with than the XML configuration.</p>,,,1,2009-03-11 03:02:15.937 UTC,2009-03-11 03:02:15.937 UTC,,2014-12-24 06:28:06.983 UTC,2014-12-24 06:28:06.983 UTC,,2050,aurealus,39803,633158,2,22,,

If you're just going to use it in a for loop you'll get better speeds by using a generator comprehension:</p> <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; y = ((x bars) for x in foos) &gt;&gt;&gt; for z in y: ... print z ...

So if you modify any one of them (including original bars) you modify all of them.</p> </blockquote> <p>I suppose this is a valid point. There are two solutions to this that I can think of. The most efficient is probably something like this:</p> <pre><code>tbars = tuple(bars) [(x tbars) for x in foos] </code></pre> <p>Since tuples are immutable this will prevent bars from being modified through the results of this list comprehension (or generator comprehension if you go that route). If you really need to modify each and every one of the results you can do this:</p> <pre><code>from copy import copy [(x copy(bars)) for x in foos] </code></pre> <p>However this can be a bit expensive both in terms of memory usage and in speed so I'd recommend against it unless you really need to add to each one of them.</p>,,,1,,2009-03-23 04:00:28.300 UTC,,2009-03-23 17:34:46.657 UTC,2009-03-23 17:34:46.657 UTC,Jason Baker,2147,Jason Baker,2147,672172,2,28,,

702285,,<p>Basic answer: It's not a problem. </p> <p>I've heard this kind of question before and it stems from a confusion with Reference Counting where circular referencing does pose a problem.</p> <p>The .NET collector doesn't count references it just scans and flags referenced objects. Those flags also prevent it from going into a loop. This is a very simple and virtually foolproof mechanism. The system doesn't need to count or track inbound references so there is zero overhead for shortlived references. But you have to keep an eye on where references exist a common problem are objects that subscribe to events. The event keeps a reference so you need to unsubscribe before the subscribing object can be reclaimed. Another benefit of GC is that the logic also works in reverse: whenever your code has access to a reference that reference is guaranteed to be valid simply because that reference exists.</p> <p>Reference counting requires the compiler to inject code every time a reference is changed copied or goes out of scope incurring a constant overhead. When the count drops to zero the object can be immediately destroyed. The system needs a mechanism to (manually) handle cycles. You can find some horror stories by searching for the COM IUnknown interface.</p>,,,2,,2009-03-31 17:59:09.700 UTC,,2009-03-31 19:22:27.143 UTC,2009-03-31 19:22:27.143 UTC,Henk Holterman,60761,Henk Holterman,60761,702000,2,1,,

491977,,<p>I don't quite get it but <a href= http://stackoverflow.com/questions/489748/wcf-client-inside-sql-clr/489881#489881 >Kev's pointer</a> finally led me to a working state. The WCF client wrapper gives you the <em>actual</em> exception - instead of the CommunicationObjectFaultedException the VS2008 proxy gives you (how has this not been fixed?).</p> <p>That exception was a FileLoadException complaining about System.ServiceModel:</p> <blockquote> <p>Assembly in host store has a different signature than assembly in GAC. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131050) See Microsoft Knowledge Base article 949080 for more information.</p> </blockquote> <p>Of course <a href= http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949080 rel= nofollow >KB 949080</a> was no help since it still refers to SQL 2005 (as an aside I've noticed a lot of the SQL 2008 error messages and such still refer to 2005 - you'd think they could've at least replaced the text in the error messages) and deals with problems after updating the .NET FX - which hadn't happened.</p> <p>That did make me think of 32-bit and 64-bit differences though. My SQL 2008 server is x64 on Server 2008 x64 - and as such has both a C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework and a Framework64 folder. Since SQL Server is a 64 bit process and my assembly would be hosted in process - I loaded the assemblies from the Framework64 folder and System.IdentityModel and System.IdentityModel.Selectors from Program Files as opposed to Program Files (x86).</p> <p>So I tried the x86 assemblies - but trying to load System.Web gives the rather cryptic error:</p> <blockquote> <p>Assembly 'System.Web' references assembly 'system.web version=2.0.0.0 culture=neutral publickeytoken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a.' which is not present in the current database. </p> </blockquote> <p>Well yeah...I guess System.Web probably does reference System.Web. Turns out StackOverflow <a href= http://stackoverflow.com/questions/400099/deploying-wcf-client-assembly-in-sql2005/403837#40383 >already has an answer</a> to this problem. Though it doesn't make much sense it looks like you need to load the Framework64 version of System.Web and the regular Framework versions of everything else.</p> <p>Unfortunately trying that solution gave me back the dreaded WCF catch all CommunicationObjectFaultedException. Annoyed by the stupidity of WCF and IDisposable I did away with the using and Dispose call so that I could - you know - actually <em>see</em> the correct exception:</p> <pre><code>var p = new MyServiceClient(new CustomBinding(b) new EndpointAddress(uri)); var result = p.Execute(); // Don't Dispose proxy or you'll lose the actual exception. try { return result.Values; } finally { if (p.State != CommunicationState.Closed) { if (p.State != CommunicationState.Faulted) { p.Close(); } else { p.Abort(); } } } </code></pre> <p>I then ended up with yet another FileLoadException this time on System.Runtime.Serialization again pointing me to the useless KB 949080.</p> <p>Figuring this was yet another case of x64 weirdness I decided that if I was going to load the Framework assemblies I should probably also load the Program Files (x86) System.IdentityModel assemblies.</p> <p>And - what do you know...it actually worked. IntPtr.Size at runtime was 8 bytes...so I was being loaded as x64. Marking my assembly as x64 (or x86) would fail to deploy - it only worked with AnyCPU. Running corflags on the assemblies loaded showed no differences between the bitness of the x86 or x64 versions so I <em>really</em> don't know what the problem is. But the following CREATE ASSEMBLIES worked:</p> <pre><code>create assembly [System.Web] from 'C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v2.0.50727\System.Web.dll' with permission_set = UNSAFE create assembly [System.Messaging] from 'C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\System.Messaging.dll' with permission_set = UNSAFE create assembly [SMDiagnostics] from 'C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.0\Windows Communication Foundation\SMDiagnostics.dll' with permission_set = UNSAFE CREATE ASSEMBLY [System.IdentityModel] from 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\Framework\v3.0\System.IdentityModel.dll' with permission_set = UNSAFE CREATE ASSEMBLY [System.IdentityModel.Selectors] from 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\Framework\v3.0\System.IdentityModel.Selectors.dll' with permission_set = UNSAFE CREATE ASSEMBLY [Microsoft.Transactions.Bridge] from 'C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.0\Windows Communication Foundation\Microsoft.Transactions.Bridge.dll' with permission_set = UNSAFE </code></pre> <p>And then deploying my user assembly as AnyCPU. YMMV may on an x86 version of Sql Server.</p> <p>Boy - I'm really starting to get annoyed at the not quite ready for prime timeness of some of this stuff.

Then all you <strong>actually</strong> need in the client is the path to the image (<code>/people/images/12345</code> or whatever).</p> <p>For storage - either is usually fine... in SQL Server 2008 you can do both at once with the file-stream type.

296594,,<p>The problem is having the groupbox as the controls' parent. Groupboxes are not supposed to have any children and using them as parents will cause all kinds of errors (including painting keyboard navigation and message propagation). Just change the parent in the buttons' CreateWindow call from <strong>group_box</strong> to <strong>hwnd</strong> (i.e. the dialog).</p> <p>I'm guessing you used the groupbox as the parent in order to position the other controls easily inside it. The proper way to do this is to get the position of the groupbox client area and map it to the client area of the dialog. Everything placed in the resulting RECT will then appear inside the groupbox. Since groupboxes don't actually have a client area it can be calculated with something like this:</p> <pre><code>// Calculate the client area of a dialog that corresponds to the perceived // client area of a groupbox control. An extra padding in dialog units can // be specified (preferably in multiples of 4). // RECT getClientAreaInGroupBox(HWND dlg int id int padding = 0) { HWND group = GetDlgItem(dlg id); RECT rc; GetWindowRect(group &amp;rc); MapWindowPoints(0 dlg (POINT*)&amp;rc 2); // Note that the top DUs should be 9 to completely avoid overlapping the // groupbox label but 8 is used instead for better alignment on a 4x4 // design grid.

4974216,,<p>Based on your question I assume you are a little bit confused. <strong>You should talk to you teacher (or whoever gave you this assignment) and find what is expected for you to do</strong>. </p> <p>Web services involve a lot of knowledge WSDL is just one part of it.</p> <p>As you probably have learned from w3schools WSDL means Web Services Description Language. It is a way to document a web service's interface to the world. </p> <p>A web service is accessible from an endpoint address something like </p> <pre><code>http://some.server.com/context/bla/whatever </code></pre> <p>This tells you where to find the web service it tells you nothing about how to call it (i.e. how are the messages going to be structured for a correct communication).</p> <p>The WSDL provides you this info: what operations are exposed how messages are composed binding used etc.</p> <p>So that you understand a bit how WSDL fits in the entire picture I'm going to use a little story.</p> <p>Let's say some company wants to offer some online services. They expose these services as a SOAP web service and make it available at address <code>http://some.server.com/context/bla/whatever</code>.</p> <p>After they advertise their services they have to actually tell their customer how to use the thing. They could send them an e-mail and tell them how to call it or they can write a Word document and tell them how to do it. But that is not practical and a mail or word document can't be used to generate client code automatically. Some dude will have to write the code by hand... poor bastard.</p> <p>This is where WSDL comes into play. It is a specification which describes the interface to the service. Beeing an XML file it is a human readable format but more importantly <strong>is a format that a machine can read and process</strong> and... as you probably guessed by now... <strong>can generate client code based on it</strong>.</p> <p>As such the company does not bother to write e-mails or documents. They document everything in a WSDL file and make that available online (the XML Schema types inside the WSDL... very important... you should read <a href= http://www.w3schools.com/schema/default.asp >XML Schema</a>).</p> <p>To simplify things even more you can (usually) find the WSDL at the same address as the web service with just an extra parameter added:</p> <pre><code>http://some.server.com/context/bla/whatever?wsdl </code></pre> <p>Based on the WSDL the clients can now generate code that can call the service (in C# with <a href= http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa347733.aspx >svcutil.exe</a> in Java with Axis <a href= http://ws.apache.org/axis/java/user-guide.html#WSDL2JavaBuildingStubsSkeletonsAndDataTypesFromWSDL >wsdl2code</a> etc).</p> <p>And Price Charming and Cinderella lived happily ever after... oh... wait.. that's another story :P.</p> <p>Seriously now.... as I said at the beginning: <strong>Talk to you teacher</strong> and ask how you are supposed to get practical with WSDL.</p> <p>Hope this explanation makes it a little bit clearer for you. </p>,,,2,,2011-02-11 21:24:22.993 UTC,,2011-02-11 21:33:43.117 UTC,2011-02-11 21:33:43.117 UTC,user159088,,user159088,,4945431,2,20,,

646691,,<p>I think it is possible to refactor too early.</p> <p>At the nuts and bolts end of <strong>design</strong> is the code itself. This final stage of the design comes in to existence as you code it will at times be flawed and you'll see that as the code evolves. If you refactor too early it makes it harder to change the flawed design.</p> <p>For example it's much easier to delete a single long function when you realise it's rubbish or going in the wrong direction than it is to delete a nice well-formed function and the functions it uses and the functions they use etc. whilst ensuring you're not breaking something else that was part of the refactor.</p> <p>It could be said that perhaps you should have spent more time designing but a key element in an agile process is that coding is part of the design process and in most cases having put some reasonable effort into design it's better to just get on with it.</p> <p><strong>Edit</strong> In response to comments:-</p> <p>Design isn't done until you've written code. We can't solve <strong>all</strong> problems in pre-coding design the whole point behind Agile is that coding <strong>is</strong> problem solving.

(Note that if these hadn't been private methods it would have been <code>invokevirtual</code> instead of <code>invokespecial</code>; see <a href= http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jvms/second_edition/html/Compiling.doc.html#14787 >JLS §7.7 Invoking Methods</a>.)</p> <p>Now as I said I don't expect there to be any great difference in performance between these two other than the fact that <code>invokestatic</code> requires one fewer bytecode. <code>invokestatic</code> and <code>invokespecial</code> should both be slightly faster than <code>invokevirtual</code> since they both use static binding instead of dynamic but I have no idea if either is faster than the other. I can't find any good references either. The closest I can find is <a href= http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-06-1997/jw-06-hood.html >this 1997 JavaWorld article</a> which basically restates what I just said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The fastest instructions will most likely be <code>invokespecial</code> and <code>invokestatic</code> because methods invoked by these instructions are statically bound. When the JVM resolves the symbolic reference for these instructions and replaces it with a direct reference that direct reference probably will include a pointer to the actual bytecodes.</p> </blockquote> <p>But many things have changed since 1997.</p> <p>So in conclusion... I guess I'm still sticking with what I said before.

481979,,<p>Some people would say that <em>two</em> threads is too many - I'm not quite in that camp :-)</p> <p>Here's my advice: <em>measure don't guess.</em> One suggestion is to make it configurable and initially set it to 100 then release your software to the wild and monitor what happens.</p> <p>If your thread usage peaks at 3 then 100 is too much. If it remains at 100 for most of the day bump it up to 200 and see what happens.</p> <p>You <em>could</em> actually have your code itself monitor usage and adjust the configuration for the next time it starts but that's probably overkill.</p> <hr> <p><em>For clarification and elaboration:</em></p> <p>I'm not advocating rolling your own thread pooling subsystem by all means use the one you have. But since you were asking about a good cut-off point for threads I assume your thread pool implementation has the ability to limit the maximum number of threads created (which is a good thing).</p> <p>I've written thread and database connection pooling code and they have the following features (which I believe are essential for performance):</p> <ul> <li>a minimum number of active threads.</li> <li>a maximum number of threads.</li> <li>shutting down threads that haven't been used for a while.</li> </ul> <p>The first sets a baseline for minimum performance in terms of the thread pool client (this number of threads is always available for use). The second sets a restriction on resource usage by active threads. The third returns you to the baseline in quiet times so as to minimise resource use.</p> <p>You need to balance the resource usage of having unused threads (A) against the resource usage of not having enough threads to do the work (B).</p> <p>(A) is generally memory usage (stacks and so on) since a thread doing no work will not be using much of the CPU. (B) will generally be a delay in the processing of requests as they arrive as you need to wait for a thread to become available.</p> <p>That's why you measure. As you state the vast majority of your threads will be waiting for a response from the database so they won't be running. There are two factors that affect how many threads you should allow for.</p> <p>The first is the number of DB connections available. This may be a hard limit unless you can increase it at the DBMS - I'm going to assume your DBMS can take an unlimited number of connections in this case (although you should ideally be measuring that as well).</p> <p>Then the number of threads you should have depend on your historical use. The minimum you should have running is the minimum number that you've ever had running + A% with an absolute minimum of (for example and make it configurable just like A) 5.</p> <p>The maximum number of threads should be your historical maximum + B%.</p> <p>You should also be monitoring for behaviour changes. If for some reason your usage goes to 100% of available for a significant time (so that it would affect the performance of clients) you should bump up the maximum allowed until it's once again B% higher.</p> <hr> <p><em>In response to the what exactly should I measure? question:</em></p> <p>What you should measure specifically is the maximum amount of threads in concurrent use (e.g. waiting on a return from the DB call) under load. Then add a safety factor of 10% for <em>example</em> (emphasised since other posters seem to take my examples as fixed recommendations).</p> <p>In addition this should be done in the production environment for tuning.

As is the case with essentially all C++0x features an experimental implementation exists.</p> </blockquote> <p>Please see the above link for a more detailed discussion on why GC is hard.</p> <p>There is also a good discussion of the topic <a href= http://www.informit.com/guides/content.aspx?g=cplusplus&amp;seqNum=222 >here</a>.</p> <p><strong>General overview:</strong></p> <p>C++ is very powerful and allows you to do almost anything. For this reason it doesn't automatically push many things onto you that might impact performance. Garbage collection can be easily implemented with smart pointers (objects that wrap pointers with a reference count which auto delete themselves when the reference count reaches 0).</p> <p>C++ was built with competitors in mind that did not have garbage collection. Efficiency was the main concern that C++ had to fend off criticism from in comparison to C and others. </p> <p>There are 2 types of garbage collection...</p> <p><strong>Explicit garbage collection:</strong></p> <p>C++0x will have garbage collection via pointers created with shared_ptr</p> <p>If you want it you can use it if you don't want it you aren't forced into using it.</p> <p>You can currently use boost:shared_ptr as well if you don't want to wait for C++0x.</p> <p><strong>Implicit garbage collection:</strong></p> <p>It does not have transparent garbage collection though. It will be a focus point for future C++ specs though.</p> <p><strong>Why Tr1 doesn't have implicit garbage collection?</strong></p> <p>There are a lot of things that tr1 of C++0x should have had Bjarne Stroustrup in previous interviews stated that tr1 didn't have as much as he would have liked. </p>,,,9,2008-09-29 01:48:07.027 UTC,2008-09-29 00:58:30.970 UTC,,2008-09-29 01:48:07.027 UTC,2008-09-29 01:48:07.027 UTC,Brian R.

(The 541 part.)</li> <li>Change the number just before the tail (the 2 ) to the smallest number bigger than it in the tail (the 4).</li> <li>Sort the tail in increasing order.</li> </ol> <p>You can do (1.) efficiently by starting at the end and going backwards as long as the previous element is not smaller than the current element. You can do (2.) by just swapping the 4 with the '2  so you'll have 34521 . Once you do this you can avoid using a sorting algorithm for (3.) because the tail was and is still (think about this) sorted in decreasing order so it only needs to be reversed.</p> <p>The C++ code does precisely this (look at the source in <code>/usr/include/c++/4.0.0/bits/stl_algo.h</code> on your system or see <a href= http://marknelson.us/2002/03/01/next-permutation >this article</a>); it should be simple to translate it to your language: [Read BidirectionalIterator as pointer  if you're unfamiliar with C++ iterators. The code returns <code>false</code> if there is no next permutation i.e. we are already in decreasing order.]</p> <pre><code>template &lt;class BidirectionalIterator&gt; bool next_permutation(BidirectionalIterator first BidirectionalIterator last) { if (first == last) return false; BidirectionalIterator i = first; ++i; if (i == last) return false; i = last; --i; for(;;) { BidirectionalIterator ii = i--; if (*i &lt;*ii) { BidirectionalIterator j = last; while (!(*i &lt;*--j)); iter_swap(i j); reverse(ii last); return true; } if (i == first) { reverse(first last); return false; } } } </code></pre> <p>It might seem that it can take O(n) time per permutation but if you think about it more carefully you can prove that it takes O(n!) time for all permutations in total so only O(1) -- constant time -- per permutation.</p> <p>The good thing is that the algorithm works even when you have a sequence with repeated elements: with say 232254421  it would find the tail as 54421  swap the 2 and 4 (so 232454221 ) reverse the rest giving 232412245  which is the next permutation.</p>,,,18,,2008-12-09 15:57:52.470 UTC,,2014-05-25 06:54:21.327 UTC,2014-05-25 06:54:21.327 UTC,,299080,ShreevatsaR,4958,352203,2,119,,

Acting upon each key press may be more limiting because you will not know what comes immediately after a given keycode (the complexity of undoing a reaction that turns out to be incorrect could mean having to go to a TextRange-based routine anyway).
