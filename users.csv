<p>I work as a senior user experience developer for IdentityMine, one of the leading companies (and Gold Partner) for Microsoft technologies such as Windows Presentation Foundation, Silverlight, Surface, Windows 7 and generally User Experience. I was IdentityMine's European branch's first employee, based in Zurich Switzerland, where I live with my wife Chi Meei and my two daughters Alise and Laeticia.</p>

<p>In October 2008, the book ""Silverlight 2 Unleashed"" that I wrote was published at Sams. This book is a complete tutorial about Silverlight and filled with code samples and illustration in full color. ""Silverlight 4 Unleashed"" (the sequel) is now in preparation and will be published in the second half of 2010.</p>

<p>Originally an Electronics engineer, I achieved a postgrade study in Software Engineering in 1999. In the past, I worked at Siemens from 1996, where I helped introduce WPF and other .NET 3.5 technologies worldwide. My job involved developing with the mentioned technologies, training and coaching my colleagues, coordinating and integrating the graphics designers' work, and relationships with Microsoft. Prior to that, I wrote embedded C/C++, and then moved to desktop computers in Java, JavaScript and eventually .NET (desktop and ASP.NET).</p>

<p>Privately, I code in Silverlight, WPF, ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET. I blog on http://blog.galasoft.ch and write on http://www.galasoft.ch where I publish articles, prototypes and demos related to the mentioned technologies. In 2008, I earned a MCTS for WPF. 2010 is my 4th year as a Microsoft MVP (Silverlight) and I was selected in 2010 as Silverlight MVP of the year.</p>",,2008-09-16 13:41:09.110 UTC,2019-07-04 15:29:03.970 UTC,Switzerland,6549,37,9,1684,,http://blog.galasoft.ch

18518,LarryF,"<p>I am a “C Family” developer with more than 20 years, working in C/C++, C#, and Objective-C.  I specialize in low-level coding, client/server applications, and even UI programs.  I recently got into iOS programming and find it very fun and challenging, while opening up a completely new world of possibilities!</p>

<p>I am into high power rocketry, and digital video/audio.  I reversed the Dolby Surround algorithm back in 1990/1991, and was constructing audio files on my Amiga that would address each of the surround speakers for demo's and such.  I have appeared on many TV shows and news clips involving High Power Rocketry (<a href=""http://www.tripoli.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tripoli.org</a>).</p>

<p>I've been programming since about 1983, when I got my first Timex Sinclar 1000 w/ 2k of RAM and a 16k RAM expansion pack.  I started writing my own game programs in 1985 and 1986, then moved on to writing serial based software in BBS programs and terminal software.<br>
I worked at Mustang Software for 6 years doing support, QA, Configuration Management, and even programming on Wildcat, QModem Pro, OLX, and later IMC, ListCaster and FileCenter, before the company was purchased by Quintus Corp. and later Avya, who shut down our offices.</p>

<p>I was in four or five episodes of The BBS Documentary (<a href=""http://www.bbsdocumentary.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbsdocumentary.com</a>), for my contributions to the BBS world, having worked and done so much at Mustang Software, including running my own 16 line BBS that still survives to this day via Telnet to <a href=""http://telnet://bbs.mlinks.com"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Missing Links Network"">telnet://bbs.mlinks.com</a></p>

<p>I have background in such subjects as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cryptography</li>
<li>Virus Research/Anti-Virus</li>
<li>Data Compression</li>
<li>Client/Server</li>
<li>Assembly Language</li>
<li>Database (SQL/Oracle/Access) Administration</li>
<li>API Development</li>
</ul>

<p>Just to name a few...</p>

<p>I am always looking to learn something, and am never happy just using someone else' code to perform tasks that I could learn how to do myself.</p>

<p>Some of the apps I have written:</p>

<ul>
<li>NNTP Server</li>
<li>Security DVR PTZ Camera Controller/Viewer</li>
<li>HTML Based Focus Group Chat</li>
<li>Wireless POS System</li>
<li>PGP Auto-Sign SMTP Server</li>

<li>Software Registration Algorithm / Key Generator</li>
<li>White-Noise Generator</li>

100519,Joey Baker,"Joey Baker is multimedia journalist, active in ‘new media’ journalism through college media websites and CoPress. As a self proclaimed geek, Baker grew up on the web and first began working in the .com industry by designing user-experience and user interface customization for a small web design firm.

As a student at  Syracuse University, served The Daily Orange photo editor for a year, transitioning the department to a first-class workflow, and tripling the size of the department. Serving next in the newly created position of Exponent of the Evolution, Baker, led The Daily Orange in the creation of a blog network, established a video journalism department, and brought the DO into the social media world.

Not content with his successes at the Daily Orange, Baker decided to change the college media industry as a whole. In 2008 he went on to be a founding-member of CoPress, a new, national, non-profit organization centered around the creation of a technical ecosystem for college media. As the business manager, he has personally witnessed the response around the nation, as upwards of 30 college newspapers responded within months of CoPress’ creation. CoPress is currently in the final round of the Knight News Challenge.

Baker is an avid consumer and debater in the new media revolution. His acclaimed and convincing blog posts and tweets have been recognized by Mark Briggs, Jeff Jarvis, Ryan Sholin and many others. He is equally interested in the creation of good content as he is with sustainable web-business models which will restore the journalism industry.

In his other life, Baker is a working EMT, an active backpacker and has excellent taste in beer. He is available for consultation regarding the evolution of towards ‘new media’.",,2009-05-03 22:23:32.347 UTC,2011-08-04 01:13:57.243 UTC,California,53,21,0,79,,http://byjoeybaker.com

250918,Reinstate Monica,"<h2>Consider supporting Monica Cellio's gofundme <a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/f/stop-stack-overflow-from-defaming-its-users"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here >>></a></h2>

<p>A popular and well-respected volunteer network moderator, Monica Cellio, <a href=""https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5193"">was terminated without warning</a> and <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/334133"">portrayed to the press as misgendering trans people</a> by Stack Overflow, Inc. All signs suggest this was an erroneous, if not malicious, decision not founded on fact, which the company is completely failing to take any responsibility for. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/333965"">This has caused an enormous and ongoing uproar in the community.</a></p>

<p>Monica and the community have been quite literally <strong>begging</strong> for
<em>some</em> kind of response from the company either opening up a path to reinstatement, or justifying their decision to terminate her, for more than a month now. She's made many good-faith offers to talk, and others have offered to mediate (and made <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=monica"">dozens of constructive suggestions on how to resolve the situation</a>). Several members of the Lavender community have spoken up on her behalf, e.g. in <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336731"">this prominent post</a>.</p>

<p>So far, Stack Overflow, Inc. has met all of this with thunderous silence. As a long-time contributor and someone always willing to see the good in the company's and its employees' actions and assume good faith, I'm still struggling to come to terms with the corporate callousness of this behaviour which we have to assume now is the new normal.</p>

<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336526"">Having exhausted all other means of communication,</a> Monica is now raising funds for potential legal action to clear her name. This is in her own interest, but arguably also in the interest of the SO community at large. While only the libel is likely to be legally actionable, it might establish at least <em>some</em> boundaries to what the company can do to its volunteers, as well as be a symbolic slap in the face of a business that appears to have lost all respect for the community that keeps it alive.</p>

<p>I have complete trust the funds will be used well and anything left over (say because they decide to do the right thing after all and legal action becomes unnecessary) will go toward good causes. </p>

<p>As stackoverflow changed their icon in celebration for several days when the US Supreme court unlawfully legislated to make gay marriage legal, I will in turn address the matter in my stackoverflow profile. That is the only way I can, in good conscience, continue to participate in stackoverflow.</p>

<p>I stand by the bible's teachings on the matter of homosexuality. I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, also known as a Mormon. That means I consider homosexuality and related immorality to be a perversion. By contrast I consider marriage to be sacred. The court has no more right to redefine the family than government can change the fact that men are born with God given inalienable rights. <br></p>

<p>Men are men, and women are women, and the whole inclusion of strange alternatives and mixtures to man and woman in the professional survey is gross.<br></p>

<p>I am also a mathematician.<br>
I quite like interesting games and enjoy playing them with those of my many wonderful children who are old enough. We will often edit what we might find to be sleazy in a game without altering the game play, which quite widens the range of games we can play while staying within what we consider to be gospel standards.</p>",,2010-05-06 22:31:09.697 UTC,2019-11-23 21:22:09.607 UTC,"Winterville, NC, United States",3876,2670,3,452,,

580083,Daniel says reinstate Monica,"<blockquote>
  <h2>Consider supporting Monica Cellio's gofundme <a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/f/stop-stack-overflow-from-defaming-its-users"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here >>></a></h2>
  
  <p>A popular and well-respected volunteer network moderator, Monica
  Cellio, <a href=""https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5193"">was terminated without warning</a> and <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/334133"">portrayed to the
  press as misgendering trans people</a> by Stack Overflow, Inc. All
  signs suggest this was an erroneous, if not malicious, decision not
  founded on fact, which the company is completely failing to take any
  responsibility for. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/333965"">This has caused an enormous and ongoing uproar in
  the community.</a></p>
  
  <p>Monica and the community have been quite literally <strong>begging</strong> for
  <em>some</em> kind of response from the company either opening up a path to reinstatement, or justifying their decision to terminate her, for more
  than a month now. She's made many good-faith offers to talk, and
  others have offered to mediate (and made <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=monica"">dozens of constructive
  suggestions on how to resolve the situation</a>). Several members of the
  Lavender community have spoken up on her behalf, e.g. in <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336731"">this prominent post</a>.</p>
  
  <p>So far, Stack Overflow, Inc. has met all of this with thunderous
  silence. As a long-time contributor and someone always willing to see
  the good in the company's and its employees' actions and assume good
  faith, I'm still struggling to come to terms with the corporate
  callousness of this behaviour which we have to assume now is the new
  normal.</p>
  
  <p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336526"">Having exhausted all other means of communication,</a> Monica is now
  raising funds for potential legal action to clear her name. This is in
  her own interest, but arguably also in the interest of the SO
  community at large. While only the libel is likely to be legally
  actionable, it might establish at least <em>some</em> boundaries to what the
  company can do to its volunteers, as well as be a symbolic slap in the
  face of a business that appears to have lost all respect for the
  community that keeps it alive.</p>
  
  <p>I have complete trust the funds will be used well and anything left
  over (say because they decide to do the right thing after all and
  legal action becomes unnecessary) will go toward good causes. </p>
  
  <p><strong><a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/f/stop-stack-overflow-from-defaming-its-users"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Consider supporting her today.</a></strong></p>

760668,endowzoner,"<p>I'm curious about any kind of innovation in the area of mobile computing as well as great products using web and mobile technologies. As the mobile world cannot be reduced to one platform and there is not one kind of mobile technology at all, I'm open-minded for new and alternative evolutions and do not focus on only one specific technology.</p>

<p>Therefore, I'm also highly interested in the international technology start-up scene. I admire everyone who comes up with a great new idea and product and brings it to the market successfully.</p>

<p>Currently, in my rare spare time I'm trying to get into great presentation techniques and improve my presentation skills. I think having a great idea is one part, but presenting it accordingly and to the right people is even more important than the ideal itself.</p>",,2011-05-19 08:42:59.183 UTC,2019-10-01 08:30:03.883 UTC,Austria,1778,1104,4,91,,http://www.runtastic.com
